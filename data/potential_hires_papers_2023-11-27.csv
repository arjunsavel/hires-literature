2,2309.12390,first light of vlt/hirise: high-resolution spectroscopy of young giant   exoplanets,astro-ph.im astro-ph.ep,"a major endeavor of this decade is the direct characterization of young giant exoplanets at high spectral resolution to determine the composition of their atmosphere and infer their formation processes and evolution. such a goal represents a major challenge owing to their small angular separation and luminosity contrast with respect to their parent stars. instead of designing and implementing completely new facilities, it has been proposed to leverage the capabilities of existing instruments that offer either high contrast imaging or high dispersion spectroscopy, by coupling them using optical fibers. in this work we present the implementation and first on-sky results of the hirise instrument at the very large telescope (vlt), which combines the exoplanet imager sphere with the recently upgraded high resolution spectrograph crires using single-mode fibers. the goal of hirise is to enable the characterization of known companions in the $h$ band, at a spectral resolution of the order of $r = \lambda/\delta\lambda = 100\,000$, in a few hours of observing time. we present the main design choices and the technical implementation of the system, which is constituted of three major parts: the fiber injection module inside of sphere, the fiber bundle around the telescope, and the fiber extraction module at the entrance of crires. we also detail the specific calibrations required for hirise and the operations of the instrument for science observations. finally, we detail the performance of the system in terms of astrometry, temporal stability, optical aberrations, and transmission, for which we report a peak value of $\sim$3.9% based on sky measurements in median observing conditions. finally, we report on the first astrophysical detection of hirise to illustrate its potential.",,2023-09-21,2023-11-22,"['a. vigan', 'm. el morsy', 'm. lopez', 'g. p. p. l. otten', 'j. garcia', 'j. costes', 'e. muslimov', 'a. viret', 'y. charles', 'g. zins', 'g. murray', 'a. costille', 'j. paufique', 'u. seemann', 'm. houll√©', 'h. anwand-heerwart', 'm. phillips', 'a. abinanti', 'p. balard', 'i. baraffe', 'j. -a. benedetti', 'p. blanchard', 'l. blanco', 'j. -l. beuzit', 'e. choquet', 'p. cristofari', 's. desidera', 'k. dohlen', 'r. dorn', 't. ely', 'e. fuenteseca', 'n. garcia', 'm. jaquet', 'f. jaubert', 'm. kasper', 'j. le merrer', 'a. -l. maire', ""m. n'diaye"", 'l. pallanca', 'd. popovic', 'r. pourcelot', 'a. reiners', 's. rochat', 'c. sehim', 'r. schmutzer', 'a. smette', 'n. tchoubaklian', 'p. tomlinson', 'j. valenzuela soto']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12390,True
4,2311.14048,seven white dwarfs with circumstellar gas discs i: white dwarf   parameters and accreted planetary abundances,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"observations of planetary material polluting the atmospheres of white dwarfs are an important probe of the bulk composition of exoplanetary material. medium- and high-resolution optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy of seven white dwarfs with known circumstellar dust and gas emission are presented. detections or meaningful upper limits for photospheric absorption lines are measured for: c, o, na, s, p, mg, al, si, ca, ti, cr, fe, and ni. for 16 white dwarfs with known observable gaseous emission discs (and measured photospheric abundances), there is no evidence that their accretion rates differ, on average, from those without detectable gaseous emission. this suggests that, typically, accretion is not enhanced by gas drag. at the effective temperature range of the white dwarfs in this sample (16,000-25,000k) the abundance ratios of elements are more consistent than absolute abundances when comparing abundances derived from spectroscopic white dwarf parameters versus photometric white dwarf parameters. crucially, this highlights that the uncertainties on white dwarf parameters do not prevent white dwarfs from being utilised to study planetary composition. the abundances of oxygen and silicon for the three hydrogen-dominated white dwarfs in the sample with both optical and ultraviolet spectra differ by 0.62 dex depending on if they are derived from the optical or ultraviolet spectra. this optical/ultraviolet discrepancy may be related to differences in the atmospheric depth of line formation; further investigations into the white dwarf atmospheric modelling are needed to understand this discrepancy.",,2023-11-23,,"['l. k. rogers', 'a. bonsor', 's. xu', 'p. dufour', 'b. l. klein', 'a. buchan', 's. hodgkin', 'f. hardy', 'm. kissler-patig', 'c. melis', 'a. j. weinberger', 'b. zuckerman']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14048,True
