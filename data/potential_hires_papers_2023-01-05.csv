5,2301.01694,diagnosing limb asymmetries in hot and ultra-hot jupiters with   high-resolution transmission spectroscopy,astro-ph.ep,"due to their likely tidally synchronized nature, (ultra)hot jupiter atmospheres should experience strongly spatially heterogeneous instellation. the large irradiation contrast and resulting atmospheric circulation induce temperature and chemical gradients that can produce asymmetries across the eastern and western limbs of these atmospheres during transit. by observing an (ultra)hot jupiter's transmission spectrum at high spectral resolution, these asymmetries can be recovered -- namely through net doppler shifts originating from the exoplanet's atmosphere yielded by cross-correlation analysis. given the range of mechanisms at play, identifying the underlying cause of observed asymmetry is nontrivial. in this work, we explore sources and diagnostics of asymmetries in high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy of hot and ultra-hot jupiters using both parameterized and self-consistent atmospheric models. if an asymmetry is observed, we find that it can be difficult to attribute it to equilibrium chemistry gradients because many other processes can produce asymmetries. identifying a molecule that is chemically stable over the temperature range of a planetary atmosphere can help establish a ``baseline'' to disentangle the various potential causes of limb asymmetries observed in other species. we identify co as an ideal molecule, given its stability over nearly the entirety of the ultra-hot jupiter temperature range. furthermore, we find that if limb asymmetry is due to morning terminator clouds, blueshifts for a number of species should decrease during transit. finally, by comparing our forward models to kesseli et al. (2022), we demonstrate that binning high-resolution spectra into two phase bins provides a desirable trade-off between maintaining signal to noise and resolving asymmetries.",,2023-01-04,,"['arjun b. savel', 'eliza m. -r. kempton', 'emily rauscher', 'thaddeus d. komacek', 'jacob l. bean', 'matej malik', 'isaac malsky']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01694,True
