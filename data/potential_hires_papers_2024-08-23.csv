0,2408.09606,global weather map reveals persistent top-of-atmosphere features on the   nearest brown dwarfs,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions display rotationally modulated photometric variability, especially those near the l/t transition. this variability is commonly attributed to top-of-atmosphere (toa) inhomogeneities, with proposed models including patchy thick and thin clouds, planetary-scale jets, or chemical disequilibrium. surface mapping techniques are powerful tools to probe their atmospheric structures and distinguish between models. one of the most successful methods for stellar surface mapping is doppler imaging, where the existence of toa inhomogeneities can be inferred from their varying doppler shifts across the face of a rotating star. we applied doppler imaging to the nearest brown dwarf binary wise 1049ab (aka luhman 16ab) using time-resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observations from gemini igrins, and obtained for the first time h and k band simultaneous global weather map for brown dwarfs. compared to the only previous doppler map for a brown dwarf in 2014 featuring a predominant mid-latitude cold spot on wise 1049b and no feature on wise 1049a, our observations detected persistent spot-like structures on wise 1049b in the equatorial to mid-latitude regions on two nights, and revealed new polar spots on wise 1049a. our results suggest stability of atmospheric features over timescale of days and possible long-term stable or recurring structures. h and k band maps displayed similar structures in and out of co bands, indicating the cold spots not solely due to chemical hotspots but must involve clouds. upcoming 30-m extremely large telescopes (elts) will enable more sensitive doppler imaging of dozens of brown dwarfs and even a small number of directly-imaged exoplanets.",10.1093/mnras/stae1995,2024-08-18,,"['xueqing chen', 'beth a. biller', 'johanna m. vos', 'ian j. m. crossfield', 'gregory n. mace', 'callie e. hood', 'xianyu tan', 'katelyn n. allers', 'emily c. martin', 'emma bubb', 'jonathan j. fortney', 'caroline v. morley', 'mark hammond']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09606,True
