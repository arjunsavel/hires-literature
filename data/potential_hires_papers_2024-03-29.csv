0,2403.18891,high-resolution spectroscopic reconnaissance of a temperate sub-neptune,astro-ph.ep,"the study of temperate sub-neptunes is the new frontier in exoplanetary science. a major development in the past year has been the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of a temperate sub-neptune, k2-18 b, a possible hycean world, with the james webb space telescope (jwst). the jwst is poised to characterise the atmospheres of several other such planets with important implications for planetary processes in the temperate regime. meanwhile, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has been highly successful in detecting chemical signatures of giant exoplanets, though low-mass planets have remained elusive. in the present work, we report the atmospheric reconnaissance of a temperate sub-neptune using ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. the long orbital period and the low systemic velocity results in a low planetary radial velocity during transit, making this system a valuable testbed for high-resolution spectroscopy of temperate sub-neptunes. we observe high-resolution time-series spectroscopy in the h- and k-bands during the planetary transit with the igrins instrument (r$\sim$45,000) on gemini-south. using observations from a single transit we find marginal evidence (2.2$\sigma$) for the presence of methane (ch$_4$) in the atmosphere and no evidence for ammonia (nh$_3$) despite its strong detectability for a cloud-free h$_2$-rich atmosphere. we assess our findings using injection tests with different atmospheric scenarios, and find them to be consistent with a high ch$_4$/nh$_3$ ratio and/or the presence of high-altitude clouds. our results demonstrate the capability of gemini-s/igrins for atmospheric characterization of temperate sub-neptunes, and the complementarity between space- and ground-based facilities in this planetary regime.",,2024-03-27,,"['samuel h. c. cabot', 'nikku madhusudhan', 'savvas constantinou', 'diana valencia', 'johanna m. vos', 'thomas masseron', 'connor j. cheverall']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18891,True
1,2403.18894,feasibility of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for   low-velocity exoplanets,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"in recent years, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared has led to detections of prominent molecules in several giant exoplanets on close-in orbits. this approach has traditionally relied on the large doppler shifts of the planetary spectral lines induced by the high velocities of the close-in planets, which were considered necessary for separating them from the quasi-static stellar and telluric lines. in this work we demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for chemical detections in atmospheres of temperate low-mass exoplanets around m dwarfs with low radial velocity variation during transit. we pursue this goal using model injection and recovery tests with h- and k- band high-resolution spectroscopy of the temperate sub-neptune toi-732 c, observed using the igrins spectrograph on gemini-s. we show that planetary signals in transit may be recovered when the change in the planet's radial velocity is very small, down to sub-pixel velocities. this is possible due to the presence of the planetary signal in only a subset of the observed spectra. a sufficient number of out-of-transit spectra can create enough contrast between the planet signal and telluric/stellar contaminants that the planet signal does not constitute a principal component of the time-series spectra and can therefore be isolated using pca-based detrending without relying on a significant doppler shift. we additionally explore novel metrics for finding such signals, and investigate trends in their detectability. our work extends the scope of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy and creates a pathway towards the characterisation of habitable sub-neptune worlds with ground-based facilities.",,2024-03-27,,"['connor cheverall', 'nikku madhusudhan']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18894,True
4,2403.19434,atmospherix: iii- estimating the c/o ratio and molecular dynamics at the   limbs of wasp-76 b with spirou,astro-ph.ep,"measuring the abundances of c- and o-bearing species in exoplanet atmospheres enables us to constrain the c/o ratio, that contains indications about the planet formation history. with a wavelength coverage going from 0.95 to 2.5 microns, the high-resolution (r$\sim$70 000) spectropolarimeter spirou can detect spectral lines of major bearers of c and o in exoplanets. here we present our study of spirou transmission spectra of wasp-76 b acquired for the atmospherix program. we applied the publicly available data analysis pipeline developed within the atmospherix consortium, analysing the data using 1-d models created with the petitradtrans code, with and without a grey cloud deck. we report the detection of h$_2$o and co at a doppler shift of around -6 km.s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous observations of the planet. finding a deep cloud deck to be favoured, we measured in mass mixing ratio (mmr) log(h$_2$o)$_{mmr}$ = -4.52 $\pm$ 0.77 and log(co)$_{mmr}$ = -3.09 $\pm$ 1.05 consistent with a sub-solar metallicity to more than 1$\sigma$. we report 3$\sigma$ upper limits for the abundances of c$_2$h$_2$, hcn and oh. we estimated a c/o ratio of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.39 ($\sim$ 1.7 $\pm$ 0.7 x solar, with errors indicated corresponding to the 2$\sigma$ values) for the limbs of wasp-76 b at the pressures probed by spirou. we used 1-d atmo forward models to verify the validity of our estimation. comparing them to our abundance estimations of h$_2$o and co, as well as our upper limits for c$_2$h$_2$, hcn and oh, we found that our results were consistent with a c/o ratio between 1 and 2 x solar, and hence with our c/o estimation. finally, we found indications of asymmetry for both h$_2$o and co when investigating the dynamics of their signatures, pointing to a complex scenario involving possibly both a temperature difference between limbs and clouds being behind the asymmetry this planet is best known for.",,2024-03-28,,"['thea hood', 'florian debras', 'claire moutou', 'baptiste klein', 'pascal tremblin', 'vivien parmentier', 'andres carmona', 'annabella meech', 'olivia v√©not', 'adrien masson', 'pascal petit', 'sandrine vinatier', 'eder martioli', 'flavien kiefer', 'martin turbet', 'the atmospherix consortium']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19434,True
