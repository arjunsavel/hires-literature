4,2405.09769,the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the ultra-hot jupiter   wasp-76b from gemini-s/igrins,astro-ph.ep,"measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (c/o) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the c/o ratios of hot jupiter atmospheres. we present two transits of the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 $\mu$m with gemini-s/igrins. we detected the presence of h$_{2}$o, co, and oh at signal-to-noise ratios of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. we performed two retrievals on this data set. a free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of $\left[\frac{\mathrm{c}+\mathrm{o}} {\mathrm{h}}\right]=-0.70^{+1.27}_{-0.93}$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of c/o$=0.80^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$. we also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within $1\sigma$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar c/o ratio ($\left[\frac{\mathrm{c}+\mathrm{o}} {\mathrm{h}}\right]=-0.74^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and c/o$=0.59^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$). a variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of wasp-76b. additionally, we found systemic ($v_{sys}$) and keplerian ($k_{p}$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3d general circulation models of wasp-76b, with the exception of a redshifted $v_{sys}$ for h$_{2}$o. future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on wasp-76b will be necessary to understand the h$_{2}$o velocity shift. finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained c/o ratios generally trends toward super-solar c/o ratios. more results from high-resolution observations or jwst will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.",,2024-05-15,2024-06-04,"['megan weiner mansfield', 'michael r. line', 'joost p. wardenier', 'matteo brogi', 'jacob l. bean', 'hayley beltz', 'peter smith', 'joseph a. zalesky', 'natasha batalha', 'eliza m. -r. kempton', 'benjamin t. montet', 'james e. owen', 'peter plavchan', 'emily rauscher']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09769,True
