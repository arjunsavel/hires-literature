3,2308.14510,atmospherix: i- an open source high resolution transmission spectroscopy   pipeline for exoplanets atmospheres with spirou,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets from the ground is an actively growing field of research. in this context we have created the atmospherix consortium: a research project aimed at characterizing exoplanets atmospheres using ground-based high resolution spectroscopy. this paper presents the publicly-available data analysis pipeline and demonstrates the robustness of the recovered planetary parameters from synthetic data. simulating planetary transits using synthetic transmission spectra of a hot jupiter that were injected into real spirou observations of the non-transiting system gl 15 a, we show that our pipeline is successful at recovering the planetary signal and input atmospheric parameters. we also introduce a deep learning algorithm to optimise data reduction which proves to be a reliable, alternative tool to the commonly used principal component analysis. we estimate the level of uncertainties and possible biases when retrieving parameters such as temperature and composition and hence the level of confidence in the case of retrieval from real data. finally, we apply our pipeline onto two real transits of hd~189733 b observed with spirou and obtain similar results than in the literature. in summary, we have developed a publicly available and robust pipeline for the forthcoming studies of the targets to be observed in the framework of the atmospherix consortium, which can easily be adapted to other high resolution instruments than spirou (e.g. vlt-crires, maroon-x, elt-andes)",,2023-08-28,,"['b. klein', 'f. debras', 'j. -f. donati', 't. hood', 'c. moutou', 'a. carmona', 'm. ould-elkhim', 'b. bézard', 'b. charnay', 'p. fouqué', 'a. masson', 's. vinatier', 'c. baruteau', 'i. boisse', 'x. bonfils', 'a. chiavassa', 'x. delfosse', 'w. dethier', 'g. hebrard', 'f. kiefer', 'j. leconte', 'e. martioli', 'v. parmentier', 'p. petit', 'w. pluriel', 'f. selsis', 'l. teinturier', 'p. tremblin', 'm. turbet', 'o. venot']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14510,True
4,2308.14511,atmospherix: ii- characterising exoplanet atmospheres through   transmission spectroscopy with spirou,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"in a companion paper, we introduced a publicly-available pipeline to characterise exoplanet atmospheres through high-resolution spectroscopy. in this paper, we use this pipeline to study the biases and degeneracies that arise in atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets in near-infrared ground-based transmission spectroscopy. we inject synthetic planetary transits into sequences of spirou spectra of the well known m dwarf star gl 15 a, and study the effects of different assumptions on the retrieval. we focus on (i) mass and radius uncertainties, (ii) non isothermal vertical profiles and (iii) identification and retrieval of multiple species. we show that the uncertainties on mass and radius should be accounted for in retrievals and that depth-dependent temperature information can be derived from high-resolution transmission spectroscopy data. finally, we discuss the impact of selecting wavelength orders in the retrieval and the issues that arise when trying to identify a single species in a multi-species atmospheric model. this analysis allows us to understand better the results obtained through transmission spectroscopy and their limitations in preparation to the analysis of actual spirou data.",,2023-08-28,,"['f. debras', 'b. klein', 'j. -f. donati', 't. hood', 'c. moutou', 'a. carmona', 'b. charnay', 'b. bézard', 'p. fouqué', 'a. masson', 's. vinatier', 'c. baruteau', 'i. boisse', 'x. bonfils', 'a. chiavassa', 'x. delfosse', 'g. hebrard', 'j. leconte', 'e. martioli', 'm. ould-elkhim', 'v. parmentier', 'p. petit', 'w. pluriel', 'f. selsis', 'l. teinturier', 'p. tremblin', 'm. turbet', 'o. venot']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14511,True
