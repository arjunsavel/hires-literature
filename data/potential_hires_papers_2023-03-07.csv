3,2303.03232,co or no co? narrowing the co abundance constraint and recovering the   h2o detection in the atmosphere of wasp-127 b using spirou,astro-ph.ep,"precise measurements of chemical abundances in planetary atmospheres are necessary to constrain the formation histories of exoplanets. a recent study of wasp-127b, a close-in puffy sub-saturn orbiting its solar-type host star in 4.2 d, using hst and spitzer revealed a feature-rich transmission spectrum with strong excess absorption at 4.5 um. however, the limited spectral resolution and coverage of these instruments could not distinguish between co and/or co2 absorption causing this signal, with both low and high c/o ratio scenarios being possible. here we present near-infrared (0.9--2.5 um) transit observations of wasp-127 b using the high-resolution spirou spectrograph, with the goal to disentangle co from co2 through the 2.3 um co band. with spirou, we detect h2o at a t-test significance of 5.3 sigma and observe a tentative (3 sigma) signal consistent with oh absorption. from a joint spirou + hst + spitzer retrieval analysis, we rule out a co-rich scenario by placing an upper limit on the co abundance of log10[co]<-4.0, and estimate a log10[co2] of -3.7^(+0.8)_(-0.6), which is the level needed to match the excess absorption seen at 4.5um. we also set abundance constraints on other major c-, o-, and n-bearing molecules, with our results favoring low c/o (0.10^(+0.10)_(-0.06)), disequilibrium chemistry scenarios. we further discuss the implications of our results in the context of planet formation. additional observations at high and low-resolution will be needed to confirm these results and better our understanding of this unusual world.",,2023-03-06,,"['anne boucher', 'david lafrenière', 'stefan pelletier', 'antoine darveau-bernier', 'michael radica', 'romain allart', 'étienne artigau', 'neil j. cook', 'florian debras', 'rené doyon', 'eric gaidos', 'björn benneke', 'charles cadieux', 'andres carmona', 'ryan cloutier', 'pía cortés-zuleta', 'nicolas b. cowan', 'xavier delfosse', 'jean-françois donati', 'pascal fouqué', 'thierry forveille', 'konstantin grankin', 'guillaume hébrard', 'jorge h. c. martins', 'eder martioli', 'adrien masson', 'sandrine vinatier']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03232,True
