3,2302.13969,magnetic effects and 3d structure in theoretical high-resolution   transmission spectra of ultrahot jupiters: the case of wasp-76b,astro-ph.ep,"high resolution spectroscopy has allowed for unprecedented levels of atmospheric characterization, especially for the hottest gas giant exoplanets known as ultrahot jupiters (uhjs). high-resolution spectra are sensitive to 3d effects, making complex 3d atmospheric models important for interpreting data. moreover, these planets are expected to host magnetic fields that will shape their resulting atmospheric circulation patterns, but little modeling work has been done to investigate these effects. in this paper, we generate high-resolution transmission spectra from general circulation models for the canonical uhj wasp-76b with three different magnetic treatments in order to understand the influence of magnetic forces on the circulation. in general, spectra from all models have increasingly blueshifted net doppler shifts as transit progresses, but we find that the differing temperature and wind fields in the upper atmospheres of these models result in measurable differences. we find that magnetic effects may be contributing to the unusual trends previously seen in transmission for this planet. our $b=3$ gauss active drag model in particular shows unique trends not found in the models with simpler or no magnetic effects. the net doppler shifts are additionally influenced by the dominant opacity sources in each wavelength range considered, as each species probes different regions of the atmosphere and are sensitive to spatial differences in the circulation. this work highlights the ongoing need for models of planets in this temperature regime to consider both 3d and magnetic effects when interpreting high resolution transmission spectra.",10.3847/1538-3881/acd24d,2023-02-27,2023-05-22,"['hayley beltz', 'emily rauscher', 'eliza kempton', 'isaac malsky', 'arjun savel']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13969,True
13,2306.03913,giant tidal tails of helium escaping the hot jupiter hat-p-32 b,astro-ph.ep,"capturing planets in the act of losing their atmospheres provides rare opportunities to probe their evolution history. such analysis has been enabled by observations of the helium triplet at 10833 \aa, but past studies have focused on the narrow time window right around the planet's optical transit. we monitored the hot jupiter hat-p-32 b using high-resolution spectroscopy from the hobby-eberly telescope covering the planet's full orbit. we detected helium escaping hat-p-32 b at a $14\sigma$ significance, with extended leading and trailing tails spanning a projected length over 53 times the planet's radius. these tails are among the largest known structures associated with an exoplanet. we interpret our observations using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, which predict roche lobe overflow with extended tails along the planet's orbital path.",,2023-06-06,,"['zhoujian zhang', 'caroline v. morley', 'michael gully-santiago', 'morgan macleod', 'antonija oklopčić', 'jessica luna', 'quang h. tran', 'joe p. ninan', 'suvrath mahadevan', 'daniel m. krolikowski', 'william d. cochran', 'brendan p. bowler', 'michael endl', 'gudmundur stefánsson', 'benjamin m. tofflemire', 'andrew vanderburg', 'gregory r. zeimann']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03913,True
