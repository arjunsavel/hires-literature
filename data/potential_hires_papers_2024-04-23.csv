2,2404.13586,the pepsi exoplanet transit survey (pets). v: new na d transmission   spectra indicate a quieter atmosphere on hd 189733b,astro-ph.ep,"absorption lines from exoplanet atmospheres observed in transmission allow us to study atmospheric characteristics such as winds. we present a new high-resolution transit time-series of hd 189733b, acquired with the pepsi instrument at the lbt and analyze the transmission spectrum around the na d lines. we model the spectral signature of the rm-clv-effect using synthetic phoenix spectra based on spherical lte atmospheric models. we find a na d absorption signature between the second and third contact but not during the ingress and egress phases, which casts doubt on the planetary origin of the signal. presupposing a planetary origin of the signal, the results suggest a weak day-to-nightside streaming wind in the order of 0.7 km/s and a moderate super-rotational streaming wind in the order of 3 - 4 km/s, challenging claims of prevailing strong winds on hd 189733b.",,2024-04-21,,"['e. keles', 's. czesla', 'k. poppenhaeger', 'p. hauschildt', 't. a. carroll', 'i. ilyin', 'm. baratella', 'm. steffen', 'k. g. strassmeier', 'a. s. bonomo', 'b. s. gaudi', 't. henning', 'm. c. johnson', 'k. molaverdikhani', 'v. nascimbeni', 'j. patience', 'a. reiners', 'g. scandariato', 'e. schlawin', 'e. shkolnik', 'd. sicilia', 'a. sozzetti', 'm. mallonn', 'c. veillet', 'j. wang', 'f. yan']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13586,True
5,2404.13849,detection of na in the atmosphere of the hot jupiter hat-p-55b,astro-ph.ep,"the spectral signatures of optical absorbers, when combined with those of infrared molecules, play a critical role in constraining the cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. we aim to use optical transmission spectroscopy to confirm the tentative color signature previously observed by multiband photometry in the atmosphere of hot jupiter hat-p-55b. we observed a transit of hat-p-55b with the osiris spectrograph on the gran telescopio canarias (gtc). we created two sets of spectroscopic light curves using the conventional band-integrated method and the newly proposed pixel-based method to derive the transmission spectrum. we performed bayesian spectral retrieval analyses on the transmission spectrum to interpret the observed atmospheric properties. the transmission spectra derived from the two methods are consistent, both spectrally resolving the tentative color signature observed by muscat2. the retrievals on the combined osiris and muscat2 transmission spectrum yield the detection of na at 5.5$\sigma$ and the tentative detection of mgh at 3.4$\sigma$. the current optical-only wavelength coverage cannot constrain the absolute abundances of the atmospheric species. space-based observations covering the molecular infrared bands or ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy are needed to further constrain the atmospheric properties of hat-p-55b.",,2024-04-21,,"['huiyi kang', 'guo chen', 'chengzi jiang', 'enric palle', 'felipe murgas', 'hannu parviainen', 'yuehua ma', 'akihiko fukui', 'norio narita']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13849,True
