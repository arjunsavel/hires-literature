1,2407.19012,the antaress workflow i. optimal extraction of spatially resolved   stellar spectra with high-resolution transit spectroscopy,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im astro-ph.sr,"high-resolution spectrographs open a detailed window onto the atmospheres of stars and planets. as the number of systems observed with different instruments grows, it is crucial to develop a standard in analyzing spectral time series of exoplanet transits and occultations, for the benefit of reproducibility. here, we introduce the antaress workflow, a set of methods aimed at processing high-resolution spectroscopy datasets in a robust way and extracting accurate exoplanetary and stellar spectra. while a fast preliminary analysis can be run on order-merged 1d spectra and cross-correlation functions (ccfs), the workflow was optimally designed for extracted 2d echelle spectra to remain close to the original detector counts, limit the spectral resampling, and propagate the correlated noise. input data from multiple instruments and epochs were corrected for relevant environmental and instrumental effects, processed homogeneously, and analyzed independently or jointly. in this first paper, we show how planet-occulted stellar spectra extracted along the transit chord and cleaned from planetary contamination provide a direct comparison with theoretical stellar models and enable a spectral and spatial mapping of the photosphere. we illustrate this application of the workflow to archival espresso data, using the rossiter-mclaughlin effect revolutions (rmr) technique to confirm the spin-orbit alignment of hd\,209458b and unveil biases in wasp-76b's published orbital architecture. because the workflow is modular and its concepts are general, it can support new methods and be extended to additional spectrographs to find a range of applications beyond the proposed scope. in a companion paper, we will present how planet-occulted spectra can be processed further to extract and analyze planetary spectra decontaminated from the star, providing clean and direct measurements of atmospheric properties.",,2024-07-26,,"['v. bourrier', 'j. -b. delisle', 'c. lovis', 'h. m. cegla', 'm. cretignier', 'r. allart', 'k. al moulla', 's. tavella', 'o. attia', 'd. mounzer', 'v. vaulato', 'm. steiner', 't. vrignaud', 's. mercier', 'x. dumusque', 'd. ehrenreich', 'j. v. seidel', 'a. wyttenbach', 'w. dethier', 'f. pepe']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19012,True
4,2407.19167,machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like   exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"the search for atmospheric biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high resolution and long integration times. in this work, we developed and tested a machine-learning general methodology, intended to classify transmission spectra with low signal-to-noise ratio according to their potential to contain biosignatures. for that purpose, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra, as having methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). the models were trained with $\sim\, 10^6$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to trappist-1 e, which were generated with the package multirex, especially developed for this work. the trained algorithms correctly classified test planets with transmission spectra having snr $<$ 6 and containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and proterozoic earth. tests on realistic synthetic spectra based on the current earth\'s atmosphere show at least one of our models would classify as likely having biosignatures and using only one transit, most of the inhabited terrestrial planets observed with the jwst/nirspec prism around m-dwarfs located at distances similar or smaller than that of trappist-1 e. the implication of this result for the designing of observing programs and future surveys is enormous since machine-assisted strategies similar to those presented here could significantly optimize the usage of jwst resources for biosignature searching, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery after dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.",,2024-07-27,,"['david s. duque-castaÃ±o', 'jorge i. zuluaga', 'lauren flor-torres']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19167,True
