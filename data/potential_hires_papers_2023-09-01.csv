0,2308.07157,"high-resolution emission spectroscopy retrievals of mascara-1b with   crires+: strong detections of co, h$_2$o and fe emission lines and a c$/$o   consistent with solar",astro-ph.ep,"the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres has proven to be successful using high-resolution spectroscopy. phase curve observations of hot/ultra-hot jupiters can reveal their compositions and thermal structures, thereby allowing the detection of molecules and atoms in the planetary atmosphere using the cross-correlation technique. we present pre-eclipse observations of the ultra-hot jupiter, mascara-1b, observed with the recently upgraded crires+ high-resolution infrared spectrograph at the vlt. we report a detection of $\rm fe$ ($\approx$8.3$\sigma$) in the k-band and confirm previous detections of $\rm co$ (>15$\sigma$) and $\rm h_2o$ (>10$\sigma$) in the day-side atmosphere of mascara-1b. using a bayesian inference framework, we retrieve the abundances of the detected species and constrain planetary orbital velocities, $t$-$p$ profiles, and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio ($\rm c/o$). a free retrieval results in an elevated $\rm co$ abundance ($\log_{10}$($\chi_{\rm{{}^{12}co}}$) = $-2.85^{+0.57}_{-0.69}$), leading to a super-solar $\rm c/o$ ratio. more realistically, allowing for vertically-varying chemistry in the atmosphere by incorporating a chemical-equilibrium model results in a $\rm c/o$ of $0.68^{+0.12}_{-0.22}$ and a metallicity of $[\rm m/h] = 0.62^{+0.28}_{-0.55}$, both consistent with solar values. finally, we also report a slight offset of the $\rm fe$ feature in both k$_{\rm p}$ and v$_{\rm sys}$ that could be a signature of atmospheric dynamics. due to the 3d structure of exoplanet atmospheres and the exclusion of time/phase dependence in our 1d forward models, further follow-up observations and analysis are required to confirm or refute this result.",10.1093/mnras/stad2476,2023-08-14,,"['swaetha ramkumar', 'neale p. gibson', 'stevanus k. nugroho', 'cathal maguire', 'mark fortune']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07157,True
