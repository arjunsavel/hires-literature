5,2405.10841,the eso supjup survey i: chemical and isotopic characterisation of the   late l-dwarf denis j0255-4700 with crires$^+$,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"it has been proposed that the distinct formation and evolution of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may affect the chemical and isotopic content of their atmospheres. recent work has indeed shown differences in the $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c isotope ratio, provisionally attributed to the top-down formation of brown dwarfs and the core accretion pathway of super-jupiters. the eso supjup survey aims to disentangle the formation pathways of isolated brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions using chemical and isotopic tracers. the survey uses high-resolution spectroscopy with the recently upgraded vlt/crires$^+$ spectrograph, covering a total of 49 targets. here, we present the first results: an atmospheric characterisation of denis j0255-4700, an isolated brown dwarf near the l-t transition. we analyse its k-band spectrum using a retrieval framework where the radiative transfer code petitradtrans is coupled to pymultinest. gaussian processes are employed to model inter-pixel correlations and we adopt an updated parameterisation of the pt-profile. abundances of co, h$_2$o, ch$_4$, and nh$_3$ are retrieved for this fast-rotating l-dwarf. the exomol h$_2$o line list provides a significantly better fit than that of hitemp. a free-chemistry retrieval is strongly favoured over equilibrium chemistry, caused by an under-abundance of ch$_4$. the free-chemistry retrieval constrains a super-solar c/o-ratio of $\sim0.68$ and a solar metallicity. we find tentative evidence ($\sim3\sigma$) for the presence of $^{13}$co, with a constraint on the isotope ratio of $\mathrm{^{12}c/^{13}c}=184^{+61}_{-40}$ and a lower limit of $\gtrsim97$, suggesting a depletion of $^{13}$c compared to the interstellar medium ($\sim68$). high-resolution, high signal-to-noise k-band spectra provide an excellent means to constrain the chemistry and isotopic content of sub-stellar objects, as is the main objective of the eso supjup survey.",,2024-05-17,,"['s. de regt', 's. gandhi', 'i. a. g. snellen', 'y. zhang', 'c. ginski', 'd. gonzález picos', 'a. y. kesseli', 'r. landman', 'p. mollière', 'e. nasedkin', 'a. sánchez-lópez', 't. stolker']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10841,True
