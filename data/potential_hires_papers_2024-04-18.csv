3,2404.10463,high-resolution atmospheric retrievals of wasp-76b transmission   spectroscopy with espresso: monitoring limb asymmetries across multiple   transits,astro-ph.ep,"direct atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets at high-resolution have recently allowed for a more detailed characterisation of their chemistry and dynamics from the ground. by monitoring the longitudinal distribution of species, as well as the varying vertical temperature structure and dynamics between the limbs of wasp-76b, across multiple transits, we aim to enhance our understanding of the 3d nature and chemical/dynamical evolution of such objects over the timescales of months/years. we present retrievals of three vlt/espresso observations of the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-76b, including one not yet reported in the literature, from which we constrain the atmospheric abundances, vertical temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics for both the leading and trailing limbs of the atmosphere separately, via novel rotational broadening kernels. we confirm the presence of vo recently reported in the atmosphere of wasp-76b. we find a uniform longitudinal distribution of fe and mg across the limbs of the atmosphere, for each of our transits, consistent with previous works as well as with stellar values. we constrain substellar na/fe and cr/fe ratios across each of our transits, consistent with previous studies of wasp-76b. where constrained, v/fe and vo/fe ratios were also found to be broadly consistent between the limbs of the atmosphere for each of the transits, as well as with previous studies. however, for two of the transits, both v and vo were unconstrained in the leading limb, suggesting possible depletion due to recombination and condensation. the consistency of our constraints across multiple high-resolution observations, as well as with previous studies using varying modelling/retrieval frameworks and/or instruments, affirms the efficacy of high-resolution ground-based retrievals of exoplanetary atmospheres.",,2024-04-16,2024-04-17,"['cathal maguire', 'neale p. gibson', 'stevanus k. nugroho', 'mark fortune', 'swaetha ramkumar', 'siddharth gandhi', 'ernst de mooij']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10463,True
5,2404.11523,fresh view of the hot brown dwarf hd 984 b through high-resolution   spectroscopy,astro-ph.sr astro-ph.ep,"context. high-resolution spectroscopy has the potential to drive a better understanding of the atmospheric composition, physics, and dynamics of young exoplanets and brown dwarfs, bringing clear insights into the formation channel of individual objects. aims. using the keck planet imager and characterizer (kpic; r = 35,000), we aim to characterize a young brown dwarf hd 984 b. by measuring its c/o and 12co/13co ratios, we expect to gain new knowledge about its origin by confirming the difference in the formation pathways between brown dwarfs and super-jupiters. methods. we analysed the kpic high-resolution spectrum (2.29-2.49 {\mu}m) of hd 984 b using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on nested sampling and petitradtrans, using both clear and cloudy models. results. using our best-fit model, we find c/o = 0.50+0.01-0.01 (0.01 is the statistical error) for hd 984 b which agrees with that of its host star within 1{\sigma} (0.40+0.20-0.20). we also retrieve an isotopolog 12co/13co ratio of 98+20-25 in its atmosphere, which is similar to that of the sun. in addition, hd 984 b has a substellar metallicity with [fe/h] = -0.62+0.02-0.02. finally, we find that most of the retrieved parameters are independent of our choice of retrieval model. conclusions. from our measured c/o and 12co/13co, the favored formation mechanism of hd 984 b seems to be via gravitational collapse or disk instability and not core accretion, which is a favored formation mechanism for giant exoplanets with m < 13 mjup and semimajor axis between 10 and 100 au. however, with only a few brown dwarfs with a measured 12co/13co ratio, similar analyses using high-resolution spectroscopy will become essential in order to determine planet formation processes more precisely.",,2024-04-17,,"['j. c. costes', 'j. w. xuan', 'a. vigan', 'j. wang', ""v. d'orazi"", 'p. molliÃ¨re', 'a. baker', 'r. bartos', 'g. a. blake', 'b. calvin', 's. cetre', 'j. delorme', 'g. doppmann', 'd. echeveri', 'l. finnerty', 'm. p. fitzgerald', 'c. hsu', 'n. jovanovic', 'r. lopez', 'd. mawet', 'e. morris', 'j. pezzato', 'c. l. phillips', 'j. ruffio', 'b. sappey', 'a. schneeberger', 't. schofield', 'a. j. skemer', 'j. k. wallace', 'j. wang']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11523,True
