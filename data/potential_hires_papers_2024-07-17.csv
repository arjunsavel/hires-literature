4,2407.11281,high-resolution dayside spectroscopy of wasp-189b: detection of iron   during the ghost/gemini south system verification run,astro-ph.ep,"with high equilibrium temperatures and tidally locked rotation, ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) are unique laboratories within which to probe extreme atmospheric physics and chemistry. in this paper, we present high-resolution dayside spectroscopy of the uhj wasp-189b obtained with the new gemini high-resolution optical spectrograph (ghost) at the gemini south observatory. the observations, which cover three hours of post-eclipse orbital phases, were obtained during the instrument's system verification run. we detect the planet's atmosphere via the doppler cross-correlation technique, and recover a detection of neutral iron in the planet's dayside atmosphere at a significance of 7.5$\sigma$ in the red-arm of the data, verifying the presence of a thermal inversion. we also investigate the presence of other species in the atmosphere and discuss the implications of model injection/recovery tests. these results represent the first atmospheric characterization of an exoplanet with ghost's high-resolution mode, and demonstrate the potential of this new instrument in detecting and studying ultra-hot exoplanet atmospheres.",,2024-07-15,,"['emily k. deibert', 'adam b. langeveld', 'mitchell e. young', 'laura flagg', 'jake d. turner', 'peter c. b. smith', 'ernst j. w. de mooij', 'ray jayawardhana', 'kristin chiboucas', 'roberto gamen', 'christian r. hayes', 'jeong-eun heo', 'miji jeong', 'venu kalari', 'eder martioli', 'vinicius m. placco', 'siyi xu', 'ruben diaz', 'manuel gomez-jimenez', 'carlos quiroz', 'roque ruiz-carmona', 'chris simpson', 'alan w. mcconnachie', 'john pazder', 'gregory burley', 'michael ireland', 'fletcher waller', 'trystyn a. m. berg', 'j. gordon robertson', 'david o. jones', 'kathleen labrie', 'susan ridgway', 'joanna thomas-osip']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11281,True
