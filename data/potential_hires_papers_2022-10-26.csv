0,1304.0395,carbon and oxygen abundances in the hot jupiter exoplanet host star   xo-2n and its binary companion,astro-ph.sr astro-ph.ep,"with the aim of connecting the compositions of stars and planets, we present the abundances of carbon and oxygen, as well as iron and nickel, for the transiting exoplanet host star xo-2n and its wide-separation binary companion xo-2s. stellar parameters are derived from high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra, and the two stars are found to be similar in their teff, log g, iron ([fe/h]), nickel ([ni/h]) abundances. their carbon ([c/h]) and oxygen ([o/h]) abundances also overlap within errors, although xo-2n may be slightly more c-rich and o-rich than xo-2s. the c/o ratios of both stars (~0.60+/-0.20) may also be somewhat larger than solar (c/o~0.50). the xo-2 system has a transiting hot jupiter orbiting one binary component but not the other, allowing us to probe the potential effects planet formation might have on the host star composition. additionally, with multiple observations of its atmosphere the transiting exoplanet xo-2b lends itself to compositional analysis, which can be compared to the natal chemical environment established by our binary star elemental abundances. this work sets the stage for determining how similar/different exoplanet and host star compositions are, and the implications for planet formation, by discussing the c/o ratio measurements in the unique environment of a visual binary system with one star hosting a transiting hot jupiter.",10.1088/2041-8205/768/1/l12,2013-04-01,,"['johanna k. teske', 'simon c. schuler', 'katia cunha', 'verne v. smith', 'caitlin a. griffith']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0395,True
19,2210.08517,transmission spectroscopy of wasp-7 b with uves -- detection of na i   d$_2$ and tentative d$_1$ line absorption,astro-ph.ep,"transmission spectroscopy is a prime technique to study the chemical composition and structure of exoplanetary atmospheres. strong excess absorption signals have been detected in the optical na i d1, 2 fraunhofer lines during transits of hot jupiters, which are attributed to the planetary atmospheres and allow us to constrain its structure. we study the atmosphere of wasp-7 b by means of high-resolution transit spectroscopy in the sodium lines. we analyzed a spectral transit time series of 89 high-resolution spectra of the hot jupiter wasp-7 b that was observed using the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph (uves). we used the telluric lines for an accurate alignment of the spectra and carry out a telluric correction with molecfit. stellar magnetic activity was monitored by investigating chromospheric lines such as the ca ii h and k and hydrogen h$\alpha$ lines. finally, we obtained transmission spectra and light curves for various lines. the star shows no identifiable flares and, if any, marginal changes in activity during our observing run. the sodium transmission spectra and corresponding light curves clearly show signs of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect (rm) and the stellar center-to-limb variation (clv) that we modeled using synthetic spectra. a statistically significant, narrow absorption feature with a line contrast of 0.50$\pm$0.06% (at $\sim 8.3\sigma$ level) and a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 0.13$\pm$0.02 a is detected at the location of the na i d$_2$ line. for the na i d$_1$ line signal, we derived a line contrast of 0.13$\pm$0.04% (at $\sim 3.2\sigma$ level), which we consider a tentative detection. in addition, we provide upper limits for absorption by the hydrogen balmer lines (h$\alpha$, h$\beta$, and h$\gamma$), k i $\lambda$7699 a, ca ii h and k, and infra-red triplet (irt) lines.",,2022-10-16,2022-10-25,"['hossein rahmati', 'stefan czesla', 'sara khalafinejad', 'paul molli√®re']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08517,True
