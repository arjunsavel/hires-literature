8,2307.00967,dream: iii.a helium survey in exoplanets on the edge of the hot neptune   desert with giano-b@tng,astro-ph.ep,"the population of close-in exoplanets features a desert of hot neptunes whose origin is uncertain. these planets may have lost their atmosphere, eroding into mini-neptunes and super-earths. direct observations of evaporating atmospheres are essential to derive mass-loss estimates and constrain this scenario. the metastable 1083.3nm hei triplet represents a powerful diagnostic of atmospheric evaporation since it traces the hot gas in extended exoplanet atmospheres, is observable from the ground, and is weakly affected by interstellar medium absorption. we conducted a uniform hei transmission spectroscopy survey, focusing on 9 planets located at the edges of the neptunian desert, aiming to gain insights into the role of photo-evaporation in its formation. we observed one transit per planet using the high-resolution, near-infrared spectrograph giano-b on the telescopio nazionale galileo. we focused our analysis on the hei triplet by computing high-resolution transmission spectra. we then employed the p-winds model to interpret the observed transmission spectra. we found no sign of planetary absorption in the hei triplet in any of the investigated targets. we thus provided 3sigma upper-limit estimations on the thermosphere absorption, temperature, and mass loss, and combined them with past measurements to search for correlations with parameters thought to be drivers in the formation of the hei triplet. our results strengthen the importance of performing homogeneous surveys and analyses to bring clarification in the hei detection and hence in the neptunian desert origin. our findings corroborate the literature expectations that the hei absorption signal correlates with the stellar mass and the received xuv flux. however, these trends seem to disappear in terms of mass-loss rates; further studies are essential to shed light on this aspect and to understand better the photo-evaporation process.",,2023-07-03,,"['g. guilluy', 'v. bourrier', 'y. jaziri', 'w. dethier', 'd. mounzer', 'p. giacobbe', 'o. attia', 'r. allart', 'a. s. bonomo', 'l. a. dos santos', 'm. rainer', 'a. sozzetti']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00967,True
