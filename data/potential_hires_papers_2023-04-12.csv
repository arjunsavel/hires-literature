11,2304.04285,"the mantis network iii: expanding the limits of chemical searches within   ultra hot-jupiters. new detections of ca i, v i, ti i, cr i, ni i, sr ii, ba   ii, and tb ii in kelt-9 b",astro-ph.ep,"cross-correlation spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in the study of exoplanets. however, aliasing between spectral lines makes it vulnerable to systematic biases. this work strives to constrain the aliases of the cross-correlation function to provide increased confidence in the detections of elements in the atmospheres of ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) observed with high-resolution spectrographs. we use a combination of archival transit observations of the uhj kelt-9 b obtained with the harps-n and carmenes spectrographs and show that it is possible to leverage each instrument's strengths to produce robust detections at substantially reduced signal-to-noise. aliases that become present at low signal-to-noise regimes are constrained through a linear regression model. we confirm previous detections of h i, na i, mg i, ca ii, sc ii, ti ii, cr ii, fe i, and fe ii, and detect eight new species ca i, cr i, ni i, sr ii, tb ii at the 5$\sigma$ level and ti i, v i, ba ii above the 3$\sigma$ level. ionised terbium (tb ii) has never before been seen in an exoplanet atmosphere. we further conclude that a 5$\sigma$ threshold may not provide a reliable measure of confidence when used to claim detections, unless the systematics in the cross-correlation function caused by aliases are taken into account.",,2023-04-09,2023-04-11,"['n. w. borsato', 'h. j. hoeijmakers', 'b. prinoth', 'b. thorsbro', 'r. forsberg', 'd. kitzmann', 'k. jones', 'k. heng']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04285,True
14,2304.04948,detection of rubidium and samarium in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot   jupiter mascara-4b,astro-ph.ep,"ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) possess the most extreme environments among various types of exoplanets, making them ideal laboratories to study the chemical composition and kinetics properties of exoplanet atmosphere with high-resolution spectroscopy (hrs). it has the advantage of resolving the tiny doppler shift and weak signal from exoplanet atmosphere and has helped to detect dozens of heavy elements in uhjs including kelt-9b, wasp-76b, wasp-121b. mascara-4b is a 2.8-day uhj with an equilibrium temperature of $\sim2250$ k, which is expected to contain heavy elements detectable with vlt. in this letter, we present a survey of atoms/ions in the atmosphere of the mascara-4b, using the two vlt/espresso transits data. cross-correlation analyses are performed on the obtained transmission spectra at each exposure with the template spectra generated by petitradtrans for atoms/ions from element li to u. we confirm the previous detection of mg, ca, cr and fe and report the detection of rb, sm, ti+ and ba+ with peak signal-to-noise ratios (snrs) $>$ 5. we report a tentative detection of sc+, with peak snrs $\sim$6 but deviating from the estimated position. the most interesting discovery is the first-time detection of elements rb and sm in an exoplanet. rb is an alkaline element like na and k, while sm is the first lanthanide series element and is by far the heaviest one detected in exoplanets. detailed modeling and acquiring more data are required to yield abundance ratios of the heavy elements and to understand better the common presence of them in uhj's atmospheres.",,2023-04-10,,"['zewen jiang', 'wei wang', 'gang zhao', 'meng zhai', 'yaqing shi', 'yujuan liu', 'jingkun zhao', 'yuqin chen']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04948,True
