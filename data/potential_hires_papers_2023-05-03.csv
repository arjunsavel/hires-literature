9,2303.03232,co or no co? narrowing the co abundance constraint and recovering the   h2o detection in the atmosphere of wasp-127 b using spirou,astro-ph.ep,"precise measurements of chemical abundances in planetary atmospheres are necessary to constrain the formation histories of exoplanets. a recent study of wasp-127b, a close-in puffy sub-saturn orbiting its solar-type host star in 4.2 d, using hst and spitzer revealed a feature-rich transmission spectrum with strong excess absorption at 4.5 um. however, the limited spectral resolution and coverage of these instruments could not distinguish between co and/or co2 absorption causing this signal, with both low and high c/o ratio scenarios being possible. here we present near-infrared (0.9--2.5 um) transit observations of wasp-127 b using the high-resolution spirou spectrograph, with the goal to disentangle co from co2 through the 2.3 um co band. with spirou, we detect h2o at a t-test significance of 5.3 sigma and observe a tentative (3 sigma) signal consistent with oh absorption. from a joint spirou + hst + spitzer retrieval analysis, we rule out a co-rich scenario by placing an upper limit on the co abundance of log10[co]<-4.0, and estimate a log10[co2] of -3.7^(+0.8)_(-0.6), which is the level needed to match the excess absorption seen at 4.5um. we also set abundance constraints on other major c-, o-, and n-bearing molecules, with our results favoring low c/o (0.10^(+0.10)_(-0.06)), disequilibrium chemistry scenarios. we further discuss the implications of our results in the context of planet formation. additional observations at high and low-resolution will be needed to confirm these results and better our understanding of this unusual world.",10.1093/mnras/stad1247,2023-03-06,,"['anne boucher', 'david lafrenière', 'stefan pelletier', 'antoine darveau-bernier', 'michael radica', 'romain allart', 'étienne artigau', 'neil j. cook', 'florian debras', 'rené doyon', 'eric gaidos', 'björn benneke', 'charles cadieux', 'andres carmona', 'ryan cloutier', 'pía cortés-zuleta', 'nicolas b. cowan', 'xavier delfosse', 'jean-françois donati', 'pascal fouqué', 'thierry forveille', 'konstantin grankin', 'guillaume hébrard', 'jorge h. c. martins', 'eder martioli', 'adrien masson', 'sandrine vinatier']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03232,True
11,2303.08205,the iag spectral atlas of the spatially resolved sun: centre-to-limb   observations,astro-ph.sr,"solar surface magneto-convection appears as granulation pattern that impacts spectral lines in terms of both shape and wavelength. such induced effects also tend to vary over the observed solar disc because of the changing observation angle and, thus, the changing observation height as well. centre-to-limb observations of the resolved sun offer an insight into the variable spectral behaviour across different heliocentric observing positions, providing crucial information about limb darkening, convective velocities, and line profile variability relevant to radial velocity (rv) calculations. thus, rv measurements and exoplanet transit spectroscopy depend on precise reference templates. we want to provide a spectroscopic centre-to-limb solar atlas at high spectral resolution and high-frequency accuracy. the atlas shall help improve the understanding of the solar atmosphere and convection processes. we performed high-resolution observations of the resolved quiet sun with a fourier transform spectrograph at the institut f\""ur astrophysik und geophysik in g\""ottingen. our dataset contains a wavelength range from 4200\r{a} to 8000\r{a}. we obtained 165 spectra in total, with a spectral resolution of $\delta \nu$ = 0.024cm$^{-1}$, corresponding to a resolving power $r$ of 700,000 at $\sim$6000\r{a}. we present a centre-to-limb solar atlas containing 14 heliocentric positions. to check for consistency, we investigated the fei ~6175\r{a} absorption line and compared our line profiles with previous centre-to-limb observations and also with simulations. the line profile and also the bisector profiles are generally consistent with previous observations, but we have identified differences to model line profiles, especially close to the solar limb.",10.1051/0004-6361/202245612,2023-03-14,,"['m. ellwarth', 's. schäfer', 'a. reiners', 'm. zechmeister']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08205,True
14,2304.03248,high-resolution emission spectroscopy of the ultrahot jupiter kelt-9b:   little variation in day- and nightside emission line contrasts,astro-ph.ep,"the transmission spectrum of the ultrahot jupiter kelt-9b ($t_{eq}$ $\sim$ 4000 k) exhibits absorption by several metal species. we searched for atomic and molecular lines in its emission spectrum by observing partial phase curves with the carmenes spectrograph ($r$ $\sim$ 80,000 $-$ 95,000). we find evidence for emission by si i in the atmosphere of kelt-9b for the first time. additionally we find evidence for emission by mg i and ca ii, which were previously detected in transmission, and confirmed earlier detections of fe i emission. conversely, we find no evidence for dayside emission from al i, ca i, cr i, feh, fe ii, k i, li i, mg ii, na i, oh, ti i, tio, v i, v ii, vo, and y i. by employing likelihood mapping, we find indications of there being little variation in emission line contrast between the day- and nightsides $-$suggesting that kelt-9b may harbor iron emission on its nightside. our results demonstrate that high-resolution ground-based emission spectroscopy can provide valuable insights into exoplanet atmospheres.",10.3847/1538-3881/acc654,2023-04-06,,"['andrew ridden-harper', 'ernst de mooij', 'ray jayawardhana', 'neale gibson', 'raine karjalainen', 'marie karjalainen']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03248,True
