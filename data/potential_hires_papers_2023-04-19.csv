6,2303.01496,robustness measures for molecular detections using high-resolution   transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets,astro-ph.ep,"ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy has emerged as a promising technique for detecting chemicals in transiting exoplanetary atmospheres. despite chemical inferences in several exoplanets and previous robustness studies, a robust and consistent detrending method to remove telluric and stellar features from transmission spectra has yet to be agreed upon. in this work we investigate the robustness of metrics used to optimise pca-based detrending for high-resolution transmission spectra of exoplanets in the near-infrared. as a case study, we consider observations of the hot jupiter hd 189733 b obtained using the carmenes spectrograph on the 3.5 m caha telescope. we confirm that optimising the detrending parameters to maximise the s/n of a cross-correlation signal in the presence of noise has the potential to bias the detection significance at the planetary velocity of optimisation. however, we find that optimisation using the difference between a signal-injected cross-correlation function and the direct cross-correlation function (ccf) is more robust against over-optimisation of noise and spurious signals. we additionally examine the robustness of weighting the contribution of each order to the final ccf, and of s/n calculations. using a prescribed robust methodology, we confirm h2o in the atmosphere of hd 189733 b (s/n = 6.1). we then investigate two further case studies, of exoplanets hd 209458 b and wasp-76 b, confirming oh in the atmosphere of wasp-76 b (s/n = 4.7), and demonstrating how non-robust methods may induce false positive or inflated detections. our findings pave the way towards a robust framework for homogeneous characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared.",10.1093/mnras/stad648,2023-03-02,,"['connor j. cheverall', 'nikku madhusudhan', 'm√•ns holmberg']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01496,True
9,2304.08518,mapping the skies of ultracool worlds: detecting storms and spots with   extremely large telescopes,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"extremely large telescopes (elts) present an unparalleled opportunity to study the magnetism, atmospheric dynamics, and chemistry of very low mass stars (vlms), brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. instruments such as the giant magellan telescope - consortium large earth finder (gmt/gclef), the thirty meter telescope's multi-objective diffraction-limited high-resolution infrared spectrograph (tmt/modhis), and the european southern observatory's mid-infrared elt imager and spectrograph (elt/metis) provide the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise (s/n) necessary to doppler image ultracool targets' surfaces based on temporal spectral variations due to surface inhomogeneities. using our publicly-available code, $imber$, developed and validated in plummer & wang (2022), we evaluate these instruments' abilities to discern magnetic star spots and cloud systems on a vlm star (trappist-1); two l/t transition ultracool dwarfs (vhs j1256$-$1257 b and simp j0136+0933); and three exoplanets (beta pic b and hr 8799 d and e). we find that tmt/modhis and elt/metis are suitable for doppler imaging the ultracool dwarfs and beta pic b over a single rotation. uncertainties for longitude and radius are typically $\lesssim 10^{\circ}$, and latitude uncertainties range from $\sim 10^{\circ} \ \rm{to} \ 30^{\circ}$. trappist-1's edge-on inclination and low $\upsilon \sin i$ provide a challenge for all three instruments while gmt/gclef and the hr 8799 planets may require observations over multiple rotations. we compare the spectroscopic technique, photometry-only inference, and the combination of the two. we find combining spectroscopic and photometric observations can lead to improved bayesian inference of surface inhomogeneities and offers insight into whether ultracool atmospheres are dominated by spotted or banded features.",,2023-04-17,,"['michael k. plummer', 'ji wang']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08518,True
