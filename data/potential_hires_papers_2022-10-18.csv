5,2210.08517,transmission spectroscopy of wasp-7 b with uves -- detection of na i   d$_2$ and tentative d$_1$ line absorption,astro-ph.ep,"transmission spectroscopy is a prime technique to study the chemical composition and structure of exoplanetary atmospheres. strong excess absorption signals have been detected in the optical na i d1, 2 fraunhofer lines during transits of hot jupiters, which are attributed to the planetary atmospheres and allow us to constrain its structure. we study the atmosphere of wasp-7 b by means of high-resolution transit spectroscopy in the sodium lines. we analyze a spectral transit time-series of 89 high-resolution spectra of the hot jupiter wasp-7 b that was observed using the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph (uves). we use the telluric lines for an accurate alignment of the spectra and carry out a telluric correction with molecfit. stellar magnetic activity is monitored by investigating chromospheric lines such as the ca ii h and k and hydrogen h$\alpha$ lines. finally, we obtain transmission spectra and light curves for various lines. the star shows no identifiable flares and, if any, marginal changes in activity during our observing run. the sodium transmission spectra and corresponding light curves clearly show signs of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect (rm) and the stellar center-to-limb variation (clv) that we model using synthetic spectra. a statistically significant, narrow absorption feature with a line contrast of 0.50$\pm$0.06% (at $\sim 8.3\sigma$ level) and a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 0.13$\pm$0.02 a is detected at the location of the na i d$_2$ line. for the na i d$_1$ line signal, we derive a line contrast of 0.13$\pm$0.04% (at $\sim 3.2\sigma$ level), which we consider a tentative detection. in addition, we provide upper limits for absorption by the hydrogen balmer lines (h$\alpha$, h$\beta$, and h$\gamma$), k i $\lambda$7699 a, ca ii h and k, and infra-red triplet (irt) lines.",,2022-10-16,,"['hossein rahmati', 'stefan czesla', 'sara khalafinejad', 'paul molli√®re']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08517,True
11,2210.10004,a radiative-convective model for terrestrial planets with   self-consistent patchy clouds,astro-ph.ep,"clouds are ubiquitous\, -- \,they arise for every solar system planet that possesses an atmosphere and have also been suggested as a leading mechanism for obscuring spectral features in exoplanet observations. as exoplanet observations continue to improve, there is a need for efficient and general planetary climate models that appropriately handle the possible cloudy atmospheric environments that arise on these worlds. we generate a new 1d radiative-convective terrestrial planet climate model that self-consistently handles patchy clouds through a parameterized microphysical treatment of condensation and sedimentation processes. our model is general enough to recreate earth's atmospheric radiative environment without over-parameterization, while also maintaining a simple implementation that is applicable to a wide range of atmospheric compositions and physical planetary properties. we first validate this new 1d patchy cloud radiative-convective climate model by comparing it to earth thermal structure data and to existing climate and radiative transfer tools. we produce partially-clouded earth-like climates with cloud structures that are representative of deep tropospheric convection and are adequate 1d representations of clouds within rocky planet atmospheres. after validation against earth, we then use our partially clouded climate model and explore the potential climates of super-earth exoplanets with secondary nitrogen-dominated atmospheres which we assume are abiotic. we also couple the partially clouded climate model to a full-physics, line-by-line radiative transfer model and generate high-resolution spectra of simulated climates. these self-consistent climate-to-spectral models bridge the gap between climate modeling efforts and observational studies of rocky worlds.",,2022-10-18,,"['james d. windsor', 'tyler d. robinson', 'ravi kumar kopparapu', 'david e. trilling', 'joe llama', 'amber young']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10004,True
