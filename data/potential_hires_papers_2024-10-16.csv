10,2410.11561,atmospheric retrieval of subaru/ird high-resolution spectrum of the   archetype t-type brown dwarf gl 229 b,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"brown dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study atmospheres and their physical and chemical processes with high precision, especially in temperature ranges relevant to exoplanets. in this study, we performed high-resolution ($r \sim 70,000$) spectroscopy using subaru/ird of gl 229 b, the first discovered t-type (t7.0p) brown dwarf, which orbits an m1v host star at a separation of 33 au. we conducted atmospheric retrieval on the reduced $h$-band spectrum using the high-resolution spectrum model compatible with automatic differentiation and gpu, exojax. in contrast to previous retrieval studies on medium-resolution spectra, we obtained a c/o ratio consistent with that of the host star, aligning with the expected formation process for such a massive brown dwarf. additionally, based on the strong constraint on temperature from the high-resolution spectrum and previously measured photometric magnitude, our analysis indicates that gl 229 b is a binary, which was also proposed by brandt et al. (2021). finally, we validated current molecular line lists by leveraging the obtained high-precision, high-resolution spectrum of this warm ($\sim 900$ k) atmosphere. this study highlights the importance of observing companion brown dwarfs as benchmark objects for establishing characterization techniques for low-mass objects and enhancing our understanding of their atmospheres, given the wealth of available information and the relative ease of observation.",,2024-10-15,,"['yui kawashima', 'hajime kawahara', 'yui kasagi', 'hiroyuki tako ishikawa', 'kento masuda', 'takayuki kotani', 'tamoyuki kudo', 'teruyuki hirano', 'masayuki kuzuhara', 'stevanus k nugroho', 'john livingston', 'hiroki harakawa', 'jun nishikawa', 'masashi omiya', 'takuya takarada', 'motohide tamura', 'akitoshi ueda']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11561,True
14,2410.11731,the gaps programme at tng: tbd. studies of atmospheric feii winds in   ultra-hot jupiters kelt-9b and kelt-20b using harps-n spectrograph,astro-ph.ep,"ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) are gas giant planets orbiting close to their host star, with equilibrium temperatures exceeding 2000 k, and among the most studied planets in terms of their atmospheric composition. thanks to a new generation of ultra-stable high-resolution spectrographs, it is possible to detect the signal from the individual lines of the species in the exoplanetary atmospheres. we employed two techniques in this study. first, we used transmission spectroscopy, which involved examining the spectra around single lines of feii. then we carried out a set of cross-correlation studies for two uhjs: kelt-9b and kelt-20b. both planets orbit fast-rotating stars, which resulted in the detection of the strong rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect and center-to-limb variations in the transmission spectrum. these effects had to be corrected to ensure a precise analysis. using the transmission spectroscopy method, we detected 21 single lines of feii in the atmosphere of kelt-9b. all of the detected lines are blue-shifted, suggesting strong day-to-night side atmospheric winds. the cross-correlation method leads to the detection of the blue-shifted signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) of 13.46. our results are in agreement with models based on non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (nlte) effects, with a mean micro-turbulence of nu_mic = 2.73 +/- 1.5 km/s and macro-turbulence of nu_mac = 8.22 +/- 3.85 km/s. in the atmosphere of kelt-20b, we detected 17 single lines of feii. considering different measurements of the systemic velocity of the system, we conclude that the existence of winds in the atmosphere of kelt-20b cannot be determined conclusively. the detected signal with the cross-correlation method presents a s/n of 11.51. the results are consistent with nlte effects, including means of nu_mic = 3.04 +/- 0.35 km/s and nu_mac = 6.76 +/- 1.17 km/s.",,2024-10-15,,"['m. stangret', 'l. fossati', ""m. c. d'arpa"", 'f. borsa', 'v. nascimbeni', 'l. malavolta', 'd. sicilia', 'l. pino', 'f. biassoni', 'a. s. bonomo', 'm. brogi', 'r. claudi', 'm. damasso', 'c. di maio', 'p. giacobbe', 'g. guilluy', 'a. harutyunyan', 'a. f. lanza', 'a. f. martinez fiorenzano', 'l. mancini', 'd. nardiello', 'g. scandariato', 'a. sozzetti', 't. zingales']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11731,True
