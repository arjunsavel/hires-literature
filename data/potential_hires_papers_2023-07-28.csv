6,2307.14947,"first on-sky results of a fios prototype, a fabry perot based instrument   for oxygen searches",astro-ph.im astro-ph.ep,"the upcoming extremely large telescopes (elts) are expected to have the collecting area required to detect potential biosignature gases such as molecular oxygen, $\mathrm{o_2}$, in the atmosphere of terrestrial planets around nearby stars. one of the most promising detection methods is transmission spectroscopy. to maximize our capability to detect $\mathrm{o_2}$ using this method, spectral resolutions $\mathrm{r}\geq 300,000$ are required to fully resolve the absorption lines in an earth-like exoplanet atmosphere and disentangle the signal from telluric lines. current high-resolution spectrographs typically achieve a spectral resolution of $\mathrm{r}\sim100,000$. increasing the resolution in seeing limited observations/instruments requires drastically larger optical components, making these instruments even more expensive and hard to fabricate and assemble. instead, we demonstrate a new approach to high-resolution spectroscopy. we implemented an ultra-high spectral resolution booster to be coupled in front of a high-resolution spectrograph. the instrument is based on a chained fabry perot array which generates a hyperfine spectral profile. we present on-sky telluric observations with a lab demonstrator. depending on the configuration, this two-arm prototype reaches a resolution of r=250,000-350,000. after carefully modeling the prototype's behavior, we propose a fabry perot interferometer (fpi) design for an eight-arm array configuration aimed at elts capable of exceeding r=300,000. the novel fpi resolution booster can be plugged in at the front end of an existing r=100,000 spectrograph to overwrite the spectral profile with a higher resolution for exoplanet atmosphere studies.",,2023-07-27,,"['surangkhana rukdee', 'sagi ben-ami', 'mercedes lópez-morales', 'andrew szentgyorgyi', 'david charbonneau', 'juliana garcía-mejía', 'johannes buchner']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14947,True
