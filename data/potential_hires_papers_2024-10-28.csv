0,2410.19017,the roasting marshmallows program with igrins on gemini south ii --   wasp-121 b has super-stellar c/o and refractory-to-volatile ratios,astro-ph.ep,"a primary goal of exoplanet science is to measure the atmospheric composition of gas giants in order to infer their formation and migration histories. common diagnostics for planet formation are the atmospheric metallicity ([m/h]) and the carbon-to-oxygen (c/o) ratio as measured through transit or emission spectroscopy. the c/o ratio in particular can be used to approximately place a planet's initial formation radius from the stellar host, but a given c/o ratio may not be unique to formation location. this degeneracy can be broken by combining measurements of both the c/o ratio and the atmospheric refractory-to-volatile ratio. we report the measurement of both quantities for the atmosphere of the canonical ultra hot jupiter wasp-121 b using the high resolution (r=45,000) igrins instrument on gemini south. probing the planet's direct thermal emission in both pre- and post-secondary eclipse orbital phases, we infer that wasp-121 b has a significantly super-stellar c/o ratio of 0.70$^{+0.07}_{-0.10}$ and a moderately super-stellar refractory-to-volatile ratio at 3.83$^{+3.62}_{-1.67} \times$ stellar. this combination is most consistent with formation between the soot line and h$_2$o snow line, but we cannot rule out formation between the h$_2$o and co snow lines or beyond the co snow line. we also measure velocity offsets between h$_2$o, co, and oh, potentially an effect of chemical inhomogeneity on the planet day side. this study highlights the ability to measure both c/o and refractory-to-volatile ratios via high resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared h and k bands.",,2024-10-23,,"['peter c. b. smith', 'jorge a. sanchez', 'michael r. line', 'emily rauscher', 'megan weiner mansfield', 'eliza m. -r. kempton', 'arjun savel', 'joost p. wardenier', 'lorenzo pino', 'jacob l. bean', 'hayley beltz', 'vatsal panwar', 'matteo brogi', 'isaac malsky', 'jonathan fortney', 'jean-michel desert', 'stefan pelletier', 'vivien parmentier', 'krishna kanumalla', 'luis welbanks', 'michael meyer', 'john monnier']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19017,True
3,2410.19588,assessing methods for telluric removal on atmospheric retrievals of   high-resolution optical exoplanetary transmission spectra,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"recent advancements in ultra-stable ground-based high-resolution spectrographs have propelled ground-based astronomy to the forefront of exoplanet detection and characterisation. retrieving accurate atmospheric parameters depends on accurate modelling and removal of the telluric contamination while preserving the faint underlying exoplanet signal. there exist many methods to model telluric contamination, whether directly modelling the earth's transmission spectrum via radiative transfer modelling, or using a principal component analysis (pca)-like reconstruction to fit the time-invariant features of a spectrum. we aimed to assess the efficacy of these various telluric removal methods in preserving the underlying exoplanetary spectra. we compared two of the most common telluric modelling and removal methods, molecfit and the pca-like algorithm sysrem, using planetary transmission spectra injected into three high-resolution optical observations taken with espresso. these planetary signals were injected at orbital periods of p = 2 days and 12 days, resulting in differing changes in radial velocity during transit. we then retrieved various injected atmospheric model parameters in order to determine the efficacy of the telluric removal methods. for the close-in, high velocity injected signal, we found that sysrem performed better for species that are also present in the earth's atmosphere across each of the datasets. as we moved to slower moving signals at larger orbital separations, for one of the three datasets, sysrem dampened the planetary h$_2$o signal. in contrast, the h$_2$o signal was preserved for the telluric modelling method, molecfit. however, this behaviour was not ubiquitous across all three of the injected datasets, with another dataset showing a more precise h$_2$o/fe ratio when preprocessed with sysrem.",,2024-10-25,,"['cathal maguire', 'elyar sedaghati', 'neale p. gibson', 'alain smette', 'lorenzo pino']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19588,True
