5,2311.10239,calibration unit design for high-resolution infrared spectrograph for   exoplanet characterization (hispec),astro-ph.im,"the latest generation of high-resolution spectrograph instruments on 10m-class telescopes continue to pursue challenging science cases. consequently, ever more precise calibration methods are necessary to enable trail-blazing science methodology. we present the high-resolution infrared spectrograph for exoplanet characterization (hispec) calibration unit (cal), designed to facilitate challenging science cases such as doppler imaging of exoplanet atmospheres, precision radial velocity, and high-contrast high-resolution spectroscopy of nearby exoplanets. cal builds upon the heritage from the pathfinder instrument keck planet imager and characterizer (kpic) and utilizes four near-infrared (nir) light sources encoded with wavelength information that are coupled into single-mode fibers. they can be used synchronously during science observations or asynchronously during daytime calibrations. a hollow cathode lamp (hcl) and a series of gas absorption cells provide absolute calibration from 0.98 {\mu}m to 2.5 {\mu}m. a laser frequency comb (lfc) provides stable, time-independent wavelength information during observation and cal implements a lower finesse astro-etalon as a backup for the lfc. design lessons from instrumentation like hispec will serve to inform the requirements for similar instruments for the elts in the future.",,2023-11-16,,"['ben sappey', 'quinn konopacky', 'nemanja jovanovic', 'ashley baker', 'jerome maire', 'samuel halverson', 'dimitri mawet', 'jean-baptiste ruffio', 'rob bertz', 'michael fitzgerald', 'charles beichman', 'garreth ruane', 'marc kassis', 'chris johnson', 'ken magnone', 'hispec team']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10239,True
