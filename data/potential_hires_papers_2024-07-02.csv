5,2407.01177,towards characterising rocky worlds: trends in chemical make-ups of m   dwarfs versus gk dwarfs,astro-ph.sr astro-ph.ep,"elemental abundances of sun-like stars are crucial for understanding the detailed properties of their planets. however, measuring elemental abundances in m stars is challenging due to their faintness and pervasive molecular features in optical spectra. to address this, elemental abundances of sun-like stars have been proposed to constrain those of m stars by scaling [x/h] with measured [fe/h]. this study tests the robustness of this practice using m- and gk-dwarf stellar abundances and rigorous statistical methods. we compile elemental abundances for 43 m dwarfs for 10 major rock-forming elements (fe, c, o, mg, si, al, ca, na, ni, and ti) from high-resolution near-infrared stellar surveys. we perform bootstrap-based linear regressions on the m dwarfs to determine the trends of [x/h] vs. [fe/h] and compare them with gk dwarfs. a 2-sample, multivariate mahalanobis distance test is applied to assess the significance of differences in [x/h]--[fe/h] trends for individual elemental pairs between m and gk dwarfs. the null hypothesis of no significant difference in chemical trends between m and gk dwarfs is strongly rejected for all elements except si, for which rejection is marginal, and na and ni, for which results are inconclusive. this suggests that assuming no difference may lead to biased results and inaccurate constraints on rocky planets around m dwarfs. therefore, it is crucial for both the stellar and exoplanet communities to recognise these differences. to better understand these differences, we advocate for dedicated modelling techniques for m dwarf atmospheres and more homogeneous abundance analyses. our statistically constrained trends of [x/h]--[fe/h] for m dwarfs offer a new constraint on estimating m-dwarf elemental abundances given measured [fe/h], aiding in characterising the properties of m dwarf-hosted rocky worlds.",,2024-07-01,,"['haiyang s. wang', 'sascha p. quanz', 'suvrath mahadevan', 'morgan deal']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01177,True
6,2407.01266,evidence of water vapor in the atmosphere of a metal-rich hot saturn   with high-resolution transmission spectroscopy,astro-ph.ep,"transmission spectroscopy presents one of the most successful approaches for investigating the atmospheres of exoplanets. we analyzed the near-infrared high-resolution transmission spectrum of a hot saturn, hd 149026 b, taken using carmenes spectrograph ($\mathcal{r}\sim80,400$). we found evidence of h$_2$o at an s/n of $\sim$4.8. we also performed grid search using a bayesian framework and constrained the orbital velocity $k_\mathrm{p}$ and rest velocity $v_{\mathrm{rest}}$ to $158.17^{+8.31}_{-7.90}$ $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and $2.57^{+0.54}_{-0.57}$ $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. whilst the retrieved $k_\mathrm{p}$ value is consistent with theoretical prediction, the retrieved $v_{\mathrm{rest}}$ value is highly red-shifted ($>$3-$\sigma$). this might be an indication of either anomalous atmospheric dynamics at play or an orbit with non-zero eccentricity. additionally, we searched for hcn but no successful detection has been made possibly due to the relatively low s/n dataset. the detection of h$_2$o and subsequent abundance retrieval, coupled with analysis of other species such as co at the $k$-band, for example, might help us to get some information about the atmospheric c/o ratio and metallicity, which in turn could give us some insight into the planet formation scenario.",,2024-07-01,,"['sayyed a. rafi', 'stevanus k. nugroho', 'motohide tamura', 'lisa nortmann', 'alejandro sánchez-lópez']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01266,True
