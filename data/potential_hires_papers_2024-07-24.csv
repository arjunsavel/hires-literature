4,2405.18899,the near-infrared gatherer of helium transits (night),astro-ph.im astro-ph.ep,"this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the subsystems of the night instrument. night (the near infrared gatherer of helium transits) is a narrowband, high-resolution spectrograph, marking the first dedicated survey instrument for exoplanetary atmosphere observations. developed through a collaboration between the observatory of geneva and the universite de montreal, night aims to conduct an extensive statistical survey of helium atmospheres around 100+ exoplanets over several years. the instrument will report new detections of helium in exoplanet atmospheres and perform temporal monitoring of a subset of these.   night measures absorption from the metastable helium state during exoplanet transits, observable in a triplet of lines around 1083nm. the instrument comprises a vacuum enclosure housing the spectrograph, a front end unit for fiber injection at the telescope's focal plane, and a calibration and control rack containing calibration light sources and control hardware.   the spectrograph is optimized for efficiency, achieving a uniform throughput of approximately 71%. the primary disperser employs a vph grating in a unique double-pass configuration, enabling a spectral resolution of 75,000 while maintaining high throughput. the detector is a hawaii-1 infrared array, cooled to 85k, with the spectrograph operating at room temperature. thanks to its relatively high throughput, night on a 2m class telescope is predicted to be as sensitive as existing instruments on 4m class telescopes.   the front end unit injects starlight and sky background into two separate fibers leading to the spectrograph. it also performs near-infrared guiding and includes a mechanism for injecting calibration light.   the assembly and optical alignment of night's spectrograph and front end unit are scheduled for july to september 2024, with the first light anticipated before early 2025.",10.1117/12.3014420,2024-05-29,,"['casper farret jentink', 'francesco pepe', 'christophe lovis', 'sébastien bovay', 'françois wildi', 'bruno chazelas', 'michaël sordet', 'étienne artigau', 'rené doyon', 'frédérique baron', 'vincent bourrier', 'romain allart', 'françois cochard']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18899,True
5,2406.08166,exploring the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-178b. constraints on atmospheric   chemistry and dynamics from a joint retrieval of vlt/crires$^+$ and space   photometric data,astro-ph.ep,"despite recent progress in the spectroscopic characterization of individual exoplanets, the atmospheres of key ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) still lack comprehensive investigations. these include wasp-178b, one of the most irradiated uhjs known to date. we observed the dayside emission signal of this planet with crires$^+$ in the spectral k-band. by applying the cross-correlation technique and a bayesian retrieval framework to the high-resolution spectra, we identified the emission signature of $^{12}$co (s/n = 8.9) and h$_2$o (s/n = 4.9), and a strong atmospheric thermal inversion. a joint retrieval with space-based secondary eclipse measurements from tess and cheops allows us to refine our results on the thermal profile and thus to constrain the atmospheric chemistry, yielding a solar to super-solar metallicity (1.4$\pm$1.6 dex) and a solar c/o ratio (0.6$\pm$0.2). we infer a significant excess of spectral line broadening and identify a slight doppler-shift between the $^{12}$co and h$_2$o signals. these findings provide strong evidence for a super-rotating atmospheric flow pattern and suggest the possible existence of chemical inhomogeneities across the planetary dayside hemisphere. in addition, the inclusion of photometric data in our retrieval allows us to account for stellar light reflected by the planetary atmosphere, resulting in an upper limit on the geometric albedo (0.23). the successful characterization of wasp-178b's atmosphere through a joint analysis of crires$^+$, tess, and cheops observations highlights the potential of combined studies with space- and ground-based instruments and represents a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.",,2024-06-12,2024-07-23,"['d. cont', 'l. nortmann', 'f. yan', 'f. lesjak', 's. czesla', 'a. lavail', 'a. reiners', 'n. piskunov', 'a. hatzes', 'l. boldt-christmas', 'o. kochukhov', 't. marquart', 'e. nagel', 'a. d. rains', 'm. rengel', 'u. seemann', 'd. shulyak']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08166,True
