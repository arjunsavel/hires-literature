2,2406.09863,evidence for morning-to-evening limb asymmetry on the cool low-density   exoplanet wasp-107b,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"transmission spectroscopy has enabled unprecedented insights into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. a transmission spectrum combines contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, but these limbs may have different temperatures, compositions, and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. high-resolution ground-based observations have detected limb asymmetry on several ultra-hot (>2000 k) exoplanets, but space-based investigation into limb asymmetry is in its infancy, and limb asymmetry's prevalence in the broader exoplanet population remains unexplored. we find evidence for limb asymmetry on the exoplanet wasp-107b via transmission spectroscopy from 2.5 to 4.0 micrometers with jwst/nircam. this is one of the first low-resolution space-based measurements of limb asymmetry and is unique because, at 770 k, wasp-107b is in a relatively cool regime where planetary terminators are expected to be homogeneous. these observations imply a difference in temperature and cloud properties between wasp-107b's limbs, challenging our models of limb asymmetry in this cooler regime.",,2024-06-14,,"['matthew m. murphy', 'thomas g. beatty', 'everett schlawin', 'taylor j. bell', 'michael r. line', 'thomas p. greene', 'vivien parmentier', 'emily rauscher', 'luis welbanks', 'jonathan j. fortney', 'marcia rieke']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09863,True
