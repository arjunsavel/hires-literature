0,2212.05114,repeated cyclogenesis on hot-exoplanet atmospheres with deep heating,astro-ph.ep,"most current models of hot-exoplanet atmospheres assume shallow heating, a strong day-night differential heating near the top of the atmosphere. here we investigate the effects of energy deposition at differing depths in a model tidally locked gas-giant exoplanet. we perform high-resolution atmospheric flow simulations of hot-exoplanet atmospheres forced with idealized thermal heating representative of shallow and deep heating (i.e., stellar irradiation strongly deposited at $\sim 10^3$ pa and $\sim 10^5$ pa pressure levels, respectively). unlike with shallow heating, the flow with deep heating exhibits a new dynamic equilibrium state, characterized by repeated generation of giant cyclonic storms that move away westward once formed. the formation is accompanied by a burst of heightened turbulence, leading to the production of small-scale flow structures and large-scale mixing of temperature on a timescale of $\sim 3$ planetary rotations. significantly, while effects that could be important (e.g., coupled radiative flux and convectively excited gravity waves) are not included, over a timescale of several hundred days the simulations robustly show that the emergent thermal flux depends strongly on the heating type and is distinguishable by current observations.",10.1103/physrevlett.131.231201,2022-12-09,2023-12-07,"['j. w. skinner', 'j. nättilä', 'j. y-k. cho']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05114,True
4,2312.05078,3d non-lte modeling of the stellar center-to-limb variation for   transmission spectroscopy studies,astro-ph.sr astro-ph.ep,"context. transmission spectroscopy is one of the most powerful techniques to characterize transiting exoplanets since it allows to measure the abundance of the atomic and molecular species in the planetary atmosphere. however, the stellar lines can bias the determination of such abundances if their center-to-limb variations (clvs) are not properly accounted for.   aims. this paper aims to show that three-dimensional (3d) radiation hydrodynamic models and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-lte) line formation are required for an accurate modeling of the stellar clv of the na i d$_1$ and k i resonance lines on transmission spectra.   methods. we model the clv of the na i d$_1$ and k i resonance lines in the sun with 3d non-lte radiative transfer. the synthetic spectra are compared to solar observations with high spatial and spectral resolution, including new data collected with the crisp instrument at the swedish 1-m solar telescope between $\mu=0.1$ and $\mu=1.0$.   results. our 3d non-lte modeling of the na i d$_1$ resonance line at 5896 {\aa} and the k i 7699 {\aa} resonance line in the sun is in good agreement with the observed clv in the solar spectrum. the simulated clv curve for a jupiter-sun system inferred with a 3d non-lte analysis shows significant differences from that obtained from a 1d atmosphere. the latter tends to overestimate the amplitude of the transmission curve by a factor that is of the same order of magnitude as a planetary absorption depth (up to 0.2 %).   conclusions. in order to correctly characterize exoplanetary atmospheres, 3d non-lte synthetic spectra should be used to estimate the stellar clv effect in transmission spectra of solar-like planet hosts. the work will be extended to other lines and fgk-type stars, allowing synthetic high-resolution spectra to mitigate the stellar contamination of low-resolution planetary spectra, e.g. those from jwst.",,2023-12-08,,"['g. canocchi', 'k. lind', 'c. lagae', 'a. g. m. pietrow', 'a. m. amarsi', 'd. kiselman', 'o. andriienko', 'h. j. hoeijmakers']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05078,True
