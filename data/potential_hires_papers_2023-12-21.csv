2,2312.12976,the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and exoplanet transits: a delicate   association at medium and low spectral resolution,astro-ph.ep,"the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres via transit spectroscopy is based on the comparison between the stellar spectrum filtered through the atmosphere and the unadulterated spectrum from the occulted stellar region. the disk-integrated spectrum is often used as a proxy for the occulted spectrum, yet they differ along the transit chord depending on stellar type and rotational velocity. this is refereed to as the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect, which is known to bias transmission spectra at high spectral resolution when calculated with the disk-integrated stellar spectrum. recently, it was shown that the first claimed atmospheric signal from an exoplanet cannot arise from absorption in the core of the sodium doublet, because the features observed at high resolution are well reproduced by the rm effect. however, it remains unclear as to whether the detection made at medium spectral resolution with the hst arises from the smoothed rm signature or from the wings of the planetary absorption line. more generally, the impact of the rm effect at medium and low spectral resolution remains poorly explored. to address this question, we simulated realistic transmission spectra in a variety of systems using the evaporating exoplanets code. we find that the rm effect should not bias broadband atmospheric features, such as hazes or molecular absorption, measured with the jwst/nirspec (prism mode) at low resolution. however, absorption signatures from metastable helium or sodium measured at medium resolution with the jwst/nirspec (g140h mode) or hst/stis can be biased, especially for planets on misaligned orbits across fast rotators. in contrast, we show that the na signature originally reported in hd209458b, an aligned system, cannot be explained by the rm effect, supporting a planetary origin.",,2023-12-20,,"['yann carteret', 'vincent bourrier', 'william dethier']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12976,True
3,2312.13069,a combined ground-based and jwst atmospheric retrieval analysis: both   igrins and nirspec agree the atmosphere of wasp-77a b is metal-poor,astro-ph.ep,"ground-based, high-resolution and space-based, low-resolution spectroscopy are the two main avenues through which transiting exoplanet atmospheres are studied. both methods provide unique strengths and shortcomings, and combining the two can be a powerful probe into an exoplanet's atmosphere. within a joint atmospheric retrieval framework, we combined jwst nirspec/g395h secondary eclipse spectra and gemini south/igrins pre- and post-eclipse thermal eclipse observations of the hot jupiter wasp-77a b. our inferences from the igrins and nirspec data sets are consistent with each other, and combining the two allows us to measure the gas abundances of h$_2$o and co as well as the vertical thermal structure with higher precision than either data set provided individually. we confirm wasp-77a b's subsolar metallicty ([(c+o)/h]=-0.61$^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$) and solar c/o ratio (c/o = 0.57$^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$). the two types of data are complementary, and our abundance inferences are mostly driven by the igrins data while inference of the thermal structure is driven by the nirspec data. our ability to draw inferences from the post-eclipse igrins data is highly sensitive to the number of singular values removed in the detrending process, potentially due to high and variable humidity. we also search for signatures for atmospheric dynamics in the igrins data and find that propagated ephemeris error can manifest as both an orbital eccentricity or a strong equatorial jet. neither are detected when using more up-to-date ephemerides. however, we find moderate evidence of thermal inhomogeneity and measure a cooler nightside that presents itself in the later phases after secondary eclipse.",,2023-12-20,,"['peter smith', 'michael line', 'jacob bean', 'matteo brogi', 'prune august', 'luis welbanks', 'jean-michel desert', 'jonathan lunine', 'jorge sanchez', 'megan mansfield', 'lorenzo pino', 'emily rauscher', 'eliza kempton', 'joseph zalesky', 'martin fowler']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13069,True
