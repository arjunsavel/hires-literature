2,2312.01924,saltire -- a model to measure dynamical masses for high-contrast   binaries and exoplanets with high-resolution spectroscopy,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"high-resolution cross-correlation methods are widely used to discover and to characterise atomic and molecular species in exoplanet atmospheres. the characteristic cross-correlation signal is typically represented as a function of the velocity of the system, and the semi-amplitude of the planet's orbit. we present saltire, a fast and simple model that accurately reproduces the shape of such cross-correlation signals, allowing a direct fit to the data by using a minimum set of parameters. we show how to use this model on the detection of atmospheric co in archival data of the hot jupiter tau bootis b, and how saltire can be used to estimate the semi-amplitude and rest velocity of high brightness-ratio binaries. by including the shape of the signal, we demonstrate that our model allows to robustly derive the signal position up to 10 times more accurate, compared to conventional methods. furthermore, we discuss the impact of correlated noise and demonstrate that saltire is a robust tool for estimating systematic uncertainties on the signal position. saltire opens a new door to analyse high signal-to-noise data to accurately study atmospheric dynamics and to measure precise dynamical masses for exoplanets and faint stellar companions. we show, that the phase-resolved shape of the atmospheric ccf signal can accurately be reproduced, allowing studies of phase-dependent signal changes and to disentangle them from noise and data aliases.",,2023-12-04,2024-02-12,"['daniel sebastian', 'amaury h. m. j. triaud', 'matteo brogi']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01924,True
4,2402.07047,cortecs: a python package for compressing opacities,astro-ph.im astro-ph.ep,"the absorption and emission of light by exoplanet atmospheres encode details of atmospheric composition, temperature, and dynamics. fundamentally, simulating these processes requires detailed knowledge of the opacity of gases within an atmosphere. when modeling broad wavelength ranges at high resolution, such opacity data for even a single gas can take up multiple gigabytes of system random-access memory (ram). this aspect can be a limiting factor when considering the number of gases to consider in a simulation, the sampling strategy used for inference, or even the architecture of the system used for calculations. here, we present cortecs, a python tool for compressing opacity data. cortecs provides flexible methods for fitting the temperature, pressure, and wavelength dependencies of opacity data and for evaluating the opacity with accelerated, gpu-friendly methods. the package is actively developed on github (https://github.com/arjunsavel/cortecs), and it is available for download with pip.",,2024-02-10,,"['arjun b. savel', 'megan bedell', 'eliza m. -r. kempton']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07047,True
