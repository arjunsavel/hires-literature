4,2404.16732,the mopys project: a survey of 70 planets in search of extended he i and   h atmospheres. no evidence of enhanced evaporation in young planets,astro-ph.ep,"during the first gyr of their life, exoplanet atmospheres suffer from different atmospheric escape phenomena that can strongly affect the shape and morphology of the exoplanet itself. these processes can be studied with ly$\alpha$, h$\alpha$ and/or he i triplet observations. we present high-resolution spectroscopy observations from carmenes and giarps checking for he i and h$\alpha$ signals in 20 exoplanetary atmospheres: v1298tau c, k2-100b, hd63433b, hd63433c, hd73583b, hd73583c, k2-77b, toi-2076b, toi-2048b, hd235088b, toi-1807b, toi-1136d, toi-1268b, toi-1683b, toi-2018b, mascara-2b, wasp-189b, toi-2046b, toi-1431b, and hat-p-57b. we report two new high-resolution spectroscopy he i detections for toi-1268b and toi-2018b, and an h$\alpha$ detection for toi-1136d. the mopys (measuring out-flows in planets orbiting young stars) project aims to understand the evaporating phenomena and test their predictions from the current observations. we compiled a list of 70 exoplanets with he i and/or h$\alpha$ observations, from this work and the literature, and we considered the he i and h$\alpha$ results as proxy for atmospheric escape. our principal results are that 0.1-1gyr-old planets do not exhibit more he i or h$\alpha$ detections than older planets, and evaporation signals are more frequent for planets orbiting $\sim$1-3gyr-old stars. we provide new constrains to the cosmic shoreline, the empirical division between rocky planets and planets with atmosphere, by using the evaporation detections and explore the capabilities of a new dimensionless parameter, $r_{\rm he}/r_{\rm hill}$, to explain the he i triplet detections. furthermore, we present a statistically significant upper boundary for the he i triplet detections in the $t_{\rm eq}$ vs $\rho_{\rm p}$ parameter space. planets located above that boundary are unlikely to show he i absorption signals.",,2024-04-25,,"['j. orell-miquel', 'f. murgas', 'e. pallé', 'm. mallorquín', 'm. lópez-puertas', 'm. lampón', 'j. sanz-forcada', 'l. nortmann', 's. czesla', 'e. nagel', 'i. ribas', 'm. stangret', 'j. livingston', 'e. knudstrup', 's. h. albrecht', 'i. carleo', 'j. caballero', 'f. dai', 'e. esparza-borges', 'a. fukui', 'k. heng', 'th. henning', 't. kagetani', 'f. lesjak', 'j. p. de leon', 'd. montes', 'g. morello', 'n. narita', 'a. quirrenbach', 'p. j. amado', 'a. reiners', 'a. schweitzer', 'j. i. vico linares']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16732,True
