5,2209.15548,the roasting marshmallows program with igrins on gemini south i:   composition and climate of the ultra hot jupiter wasp-18 b,astro-ph.ep,"we present high-resolution dayside thermal emission observations of the exoplanet wasp-18b using igrins on gemini south. we remove stellar and telluric signatures using standard algorithms, and we extract the planet signal via cross correlation with model spectra. we detect the atmosphere of wasp-18b at a signal-to-noise ratio (snr) of 5.9 using a full chemistry model, measure h2o (snr=3.3), co (snr=4.0), and oh (snr=4.8) individually, and confirm previous claims of a thermal inversion layer. the three species are confidently detected (>4$\sigma$) with a bayesian inference framework, which we also use to retrieve abundance, temperature, and velocity information. for this ultra-hot jupiter (uhj), thermal dissociation processes likely play an important role. retrieving abundances constant with altitude and allowing the temperature-pressure profile to freely adjust results in a moderately super-stellar carbon to oxygen ratio (c/o=0.75^{+0.14}_{-0.17}) and metallicity ([m/h]=1.03^{+0.65}_{-1.01}). accounting for undetectable oxygen produced by thermal dissociation leads to c/o=0.45^{+0.08}_{-0.10} and [m/h]=1.17^{+0.66}_{-1.01}. a retrieval that assumes radiative-convective-thermochemical-equilibrium and naturally accounts for thermal dissociation constrains c/o<0.34 (2$\sigma$) and [m/h]=0.48^{+0.33}_{-0.29}, in line with the chemistry of the parent star. looking at the velocity information, we see a tantalising signature of different doppler shifts at the level of a few km/s for different molecules, which might probe dynamics as a function of altitude and location on the planet disk. our results demonstrate that ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy at infrared wavelengths can provide meaningful constraints on the compositions and climate of highly irradiated planets. this work also elucidates potential pitfalls with commonly employed retrieval assumptions when applied to uhj spectra.",,2022-09-30,,"['matteo brogi', 'vanessa emeka-okafor', 'michael r. line', 'siddharth gandhi', 'lorenzo pino', 'eliza m. -r. kempton', 'emily rauscher', 'vivien parmentier', 'jacob l. bean', 'gregory n. mace', 'nicolas b. cowan', 'evgenya shkolnik', 'joost p. wardenier', 'megan mansfield', 'luis welbanks', 'peter smith', 'jonathan j. fortney', 'jayne l. birkby', 'joseph a. zalesky', 'lisa dang', 'jennifer patience', 'jean-michel dÃ©sert']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15548,True
