3,2304.08104,grex-plus science book,astro-ph.co astro-ph.ep astro-ph.ga astro-ph.im astro-ph.sr,"grex-plus (galaxy reionization explorer and planetary universe spectrometer) is a mission candidate for a jaxa's strategic l-class mission to be launched in the 2030s. its primary sciences are two-fold: galaxy formation and evolution and planetary system formation and evolution. the grex-plus spacecraft will carry a 1.2 m primary mirror aperture telescope cooled down to 50 k. the two science instruments will be onboard: a wide-field camera in the 2-8 $\mu$m wavelength band and a high resolution spectrometer with a wavelength resolution of 30,000 in the 10-18 $\mu$m band. the grex-plus wide-field camera aims to detect the first generation of galaxies at redshift $z>15$. the grex-plus high resolution spectrometer aims to identify the location of the water ``snow line'' in proto-planetary disks. both instruments will provide unique data sets for a broad range of scientific topics including galaxy mass assembly, origin of supermassive blackholes, infrared background radiation, molecular spectroscopy in the interstellar medium, transit spectroscopy for exoplanet atmosphere, planetary atmosphere in the solar system, and so on.",,2023-04-17,2023-05-30,"['grex-plus science team', 'n/a :', 'akio k. inoue', 'yuichi harikane', 'takashi moriya', 'hideko nomura', 'shunsuke baba', 'yuka fujii', 'naoteru gouda', 'yasuhiro hirahara', 'yui kawashima', 'tadayuki kodama', 'yusei koyama', 'hiroyuki kurokawa', 'taro matsuo', 'yoshiki matsuoka', 'shuji matsuura', 'ken mawatari', 'toru misawa', 'kentaro nagamine', 'kimihiko nakajima', 'shota notsu', 'takafumi ootsubo', 'kazumasa ohno', 'hideo sagawa', 'takashi shimonishi', 'ken-ichi tadaki', 'michihiro takami', 'tsuyoshi terai', 'yoshiki toba', 'takuji yamashita', 'chikako yasui']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08104,True
4,2305.19355,trade-offs in high-contrast integral field spectroscopy for exoplanet   detection and characterisation: young gas giants in emission,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"context: combining high-contrast imaging with medium- or high-resolution integral field spectroscopy has the potential to boost the detection rate of exoplanets, especially at small angular separations. furthermore, it immediately provides a spectrum of the planet that can be used to characterise its atmosphere. the achievable spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, and fov of such an instrument are limited by the number of available detector pixels. methods: the trade-offs are studied through end-to-end simulations of a typical high-contrast imaging instrument, analytical considerations, and atmospheric retrievals. the results are then validated with archival vlt/sinfoni data of the planet beta pictoris b. results: we show that molecular absorption spectra generally have decreasing power towards higher spectral resolution and that molecule mapping is already powerful for moderate resolutions (r>300). when choosing between wavelength coverage and spectral resolution for a given number of spectral bins, it is best to first increase the spectral resolution until r~2,000 and then maximise the bandwidth within an observing band. we find that t-type companions are most easily detected in the j/h band through methane and water features, while l-type companions are best observed in the h/k band through water and co features. such an instrument does not need to have a large fov, as most of the gain in contrast is obtained in the speckle-limited regime close to the star. we show that the same conclusions are valid for the constraints on atmospheric parameters such as the c/o ratio, metallicity, surface gravity, and temperature, while higher spectral resolution (r~10,000) is required to constrain the radial velocity and spin of the planet.",,2023-05-30,,"['rico landman', 'ignas snellen', 'cristoph keller', ""mamadou n'diaye"", 'fedde fagginger-auer', 'célia desgrange']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19355,True
10,2305.19736,"on-sky demonstration at palomar observatory of the near-ir,   high-resolution vipa spectrometer",astro-ph.im astro-ph.ep,"a near-ir high-resolution, r=80000 spectrometer has been developed at ipag to directly characterize the atmosphere of exoplanets using adaptive optics (ao) assisted telescopes, and a single-mode fiber-injection unit. a first technical test with the 200' hale telescope at palomar observatory occurred in march 2022 using the palm3000 ao system offered by this telescope. observations have also been made at the same time with the parvi spectrometer so that a direct comparison can be made between the two instruments. this spectrometer uses a virtually imaged phased array (vipa) instead of an echelle grating, resulting in a very compact optical layout that fits in a 0.25m3 cryostat. using a quarter of an h2rg detector, the spectrometer analyses the middle part of the h-band, from 1.57 to 1.7 microns for 2 sources whose light is transferred from the telescope to the spectrometer using single-mode fibers. by design, the transmission of the spectrometer is expected to be 40-50%, which is 2-3 times higher than the transmission of current high-resolution spectrometers such as crires+ and nirspec. a damaged cross-disperser limited it to 21%, however. a replacement grating with a correct, twice as high efficiency has been procured after the on-sky demonstration. in addition to recalling the main specifications of the vipa spectrometer, this paper presents the control software, the calibration process, and the reduction pipeline that have been developed for the instrument. it also presents the results of the on-sky technical test with the hale telescope, as well as measurements of the effective resolution and transmission, along with a comparison of a spectrum of the sun obtained with the spectrometer with the bass2000 reference spectrum. planned modifications are also discussed. that includes the integration of a new dedicated h2rg detector, and of k-band optics.",10.1117/12.2628937,2023-05-31,,"['alexis carlotti', 'alexis bidot', 'david mouillet', 'jean-jacques correia', 'laurent jocou', 'stéphane curaba', 'alain delboulbé', 'etienne le coarer', 'patrick rabou', 'guillaume bourdarot', 'thierry forveille', 'xavier bondils', 'gautam vasisht', 'dimitri mawet', 'rick s. burruss', 'rebecca oppenheimer', 'rené doyon', 'etienne artigau', 'philippe vallée']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19736,True
