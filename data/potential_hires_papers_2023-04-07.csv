4,2304.03248,high-resolution emission spectroscopy of the ultrahot jupiter kelt-9b:   little variation in day- and nightside emission line contrasts,astro-ph.ep,"the transmission spectrum of the ultrahot jupiter kelt-9b ($t_{eq}$ $\sim$ 4000 k) exhibits absorption by several metal species. we searched for atomic and molecular lines in its emission spectrum by observing partial phase curves with the carmenes spectrograph ($r$ $\sim$ 80,000 $-$ 95,000). we find evidence for emission by si i in the atmosphere of kelt-9b for the first time. additionally we find evidence for emission by mg i and ca ii, which were previously detected in transmission, and confirmed earlier detections of fe i emission. conversely, we find no evidence for dayside emission from al i, ca i, cr i, feh, fe ii, k i, li i, mg ii, na i, oh, ti i, tio, v i, v ii, vo, and y i. by employing likelihood mapping, we find indications of there being little variation in emission line contrast between the day- and nightsides $-$suggesting that kelt-9b may harbor iron emission on its nightside. our results demonstrate that high-resolution ground-based emission spectroscopy can provide valuable insights into exoplanet atmospheres.",,2023-04-06,,"['andrew ridden-harper', 'ernst de mooij', 'ray jayawardhana', 'neale gibson', 'raine karjalainen', 'marie karjalainen']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03248,True
