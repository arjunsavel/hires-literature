1,2405.01605,prioritizing high-precision photometric monitoring of exoplanet and   brown dwarf companions with jwst -- strategic exoplanet initiatives with hst   and jwst white paper,astro-ph.im astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"we advocate for the prioritization of high-precision photometric monitoring of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions to detect brightness variability arising from features in their atmospheres. measurements of photometric variability provide not only an insight into the physical appearances of these companions, but are also a direct probe of their atmospheric structures and dynamics, and yield valuable estimates of their rotation periods. jwst is uniquely capable of monitoring faint exoplanet companions over their full rotation periods, thanks to its inherent stability and powerful high-contrast coronagraphic imaging modes. rotation period measurements can be further combined with measurements of v sin i obtained using high-resolution spectroscopy to infer the viewing angle of a companion. photometric monitoring over multiple rotation periods and at multiple epochs will allow both short- and long-term time evolution in variability signals to be traced. furthermore, the differences between the layers in a companion's atmosphere can be probed by obtaining simultaneous photometric monitoring at different wavelengths through nircam dual-band coronagraphy. overall, jwst will reach the highest sensitivities to variability to date and enable the light curves of substellar companions to be characterised with unprecedented cadence and precision at the sub-percent level.",,2024-05-01,,"['ben j. sutlieff', 'xueqing chen', 'pengyu liu', 'emma e. bubb', 'stanimir a. metchev', 'brendan p. bowler', 'johanna m. vos', 'raquel a. martinez', 'genaro su√°rez', 'yifan zhou', 'samuel m. factor', 'zhoujian zhang', 'emily l. rickman', 'arthur d. adams', 'elena manjavacas', 'julien h. girard', 'bokyoung kim', 'trent j. dupuy']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01605,True
3,2405.01933,revealing h$_2$o dissociation in wasp-76~b through combined high- and   low-resolution transmission spectroscopy,astro-ph.ep,"numerous chemical constraints have been possible for exoplanetary atmospheres thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy (hrs) from ground-based facilities as well as low-resolution spectroscopy (lrs) from space. these two techniques have complementary strengths, and hence combined hrs and lrs analyses have the potential for more accurate abundance constraints and increased sensitivity to trace species. in this work we retrieve the atmosphere of the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-76~b, using high-resolution carmenes/caha and low-resolution hst wfc3 and spitzer observations of the primary eclipse. as such hot planets are expected to have a substantial fraction of h$_2$o dissociated, we conduct retrievals including both h$_2$o and oh. we explore two retrieval models, one with self-consistent treatment of h$_2$o dissociation and another where h$_2$o and oh are vertically-homogeneous. both models constrain h$_2$o and oh, with h$_2$o primarily detected by lrs and oh through hrs, highlighting the strengths of each technique and demonstrating the need for combined retrievals to fully constrain chemical compositions. we see only a slight preference for the h$_2$o-dissociation model given that the photospheric constraints for both are very similar, indicating $\log(\mathrm{oh/h_2o}) = 0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ at 1.5~mbar, showing that the majority of the h$_2$o in the photosphere is dissociated. however, the bulk o/h and c/o ratios inferred from the models differs significantly, and highlights the challenge of constraining bulk compositions from photospheric abundances with strong vertical chemical gradients. further observations with jwst and ground-based facilities may help shed more light on these processes.",,2024-05-03,,"['siddharth gandhi', 'rico landman', 'ignas snellen', 'luis welbanks', 'nikku madhusudhan', 'matteo brogi']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01933,True
