0,2402.19352,searching for nlte effects in the high-resolution transmission spectrum   of wasp-121 b with cloudy for exoplanets,astro-ph.ep,"ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) undergo intense irradiation by their host stars and are expected to experience non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) effects in their atmospheres. such effects are computationally intensive to model but, at the low pressures probed by high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (hrccs), can significantly impact the formation of spectral lines. the uhj wasp-121 b exhibits a highly inflated atmosphere, making it ideal for investigating the impact of nlte effects on its transmission spectrum. here, we formally introduce cloudy for exoplanets, a cloudy-based modelling code, and use it to generate 1-d lte and nlte atmospheric models and spectra to analyse archival harps wasp-121 b transmission spectra. we assessed the models using two hrccs methods: i) pearson cross-correlation, and ii) a method that aims to match the average observed line depth for given atmospheric species. all models result in strong detections of fe i ($7.5<s/n<10.5$). however, the highest s/n model (lte) does not agree with the best-matching model of the average line depth (nlte). we also find degeneracy, such that increasing the isothermal temperature and metallicity of the lte models can produce average line depths similar to cooler, less metal rich nlte models. thus, we are unable to conclusively remark on the presence of nlte effects in the atmosphere of wasp-121 b. we instead highlight the need for standardised metrics in hrccs that enable robust statistical assessment of complex physical models, e.g. nlte or 3-d effects, that are currently too computationally intensive to include in hrccs atmospheric retrievals.",10.1093/mnras/stae674,2024-02-29,,"['m. e. young', 'e. f. spring', 'j. l. birkby']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19352,True
2,2406.08166,exploring the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-178b. constraints on atmospheric   chemistry and dynamics from a joint retrieval of vlt/crires$^+$ and space   photometric data,astro-ph.ep,"despite recent progress in the spectroscopic characterization of individual exoplanets, the atmospheres of key ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) still lack comprehensive investigations. these include wasp-178b, one of the most irradiated uhjs known to date. we observed the dayside emission signal of this planet with crires$^+$ in the spectral k-band. by applying the cross-correlation technique and a bayesian retrieval framework to the high-resolution spectra, we identified the emission signature of $^{12}$co (s/n = 8.9) and h$_2$o (s/n = 4.9), and a strong atmospheric thermal inversion. a joint retrieval with space-based secondary eclipse measurements from tess and cheops allows us to refine our results on the thermal profile and thus to constrain the atmospheric chemistry, yielding a solar to super-solar metallicity (1.4$\pm$1.6 dex) and a solar c/o ratio (0.6$\pm$0.2). we infer a significant excess of spectral line broadening and identify a slight doppler-shift between the $^{12}$co and h$_2$o signals. these findings provide strong evidence for a super-rotating atmospheric flow pattern and suggest the possible existence of chemical inhomogeneities across the planetary dayside hemisphere. in addition, the inclusion of photometric data in our retrieval allows us to account for stellar light reflected by the planetary atmosphere, resulting in an upper limit on the geometric albedo (0.23). the successful characterization of wasp-178b's atmosphere through a joint analysis of crires$^+$, tess, and cheops observations highlights the potential of combined studies with space- and ground-based instruments and represents a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.",,2024-06-12,2024-06-13,"['d. cont', 'l. nortmann', 'f. yan', 'f. lesjak', 's. czesla', 'a. lavail', 'a. reiners', 'n. piskunov', 'a. hatzes', 'l. boldt-christmas', 'o. kochukhov', 't. marquart', 'e. nagel', 'a. d. rains', 'm. rengel', 'u. seemann', 'd. shulyak']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08166,True
7,2406.09225,probing atmospheric escape through metastable he i triplet lines in 15   exoplanets observed with spirou,astro-ph.ep,"for several years, the metastable helium triplet line has been successfully used as a tracer to probe atmospheric escape in transiting exoplanets. this absorption in the near-infrared (1083.3 nm) can be observed from the ground using high-resolution spectroscopy, providing new constraints on the mass-loss rate and the temperature characterizing the upper atmosphere of close-in exoplanets.   the aim of this work is to search for the he triplet signature in 15 transiting exoplanets -- ranging from super-earths to ultrahot jupiters -- observed with spirou, a high-resolution (r~70 000) near-infrared spectropolarimeter at the cfht, in order to bring new constraints or to improve existing ones regarding atmospheric escape through a homogeneous study.   we developed a full data processing and analysis pipeline to correct for the residual telluric and stellar contributions. we then used two different 1d models based on the parker-wind equations and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) radiative transfer to interpret the observational results.   we confirm published he triplet detections for hat-p-11 b, hd 189733 b, and wasp-69 b. we tentatively detect the signature of escaping he in hd 209458 b, gj 3470 b, and wasp-76 b. we report new constraints on the mass-loss rate and temperature for our three detections and set upper limits for the tentative and nondetections. we notably report improved constraints on the mass-loss rate and temperature of the escaping gas for toi-1807 b, and report a nondetection for the debated atmospheric escape in gj 1214 b. we also conducted the first search for the he signature in gj 486 b since its discovery and report a nondetection of the he triplet. finally, we studied the impact of important model assumptions on our retrieved parameters, notably the limitations of 1d models and the influence of the h/he ratio on the derived constraints.",,2024-06-13,,"['a. masson', 's. vinatier', 'b. bézard', 'm. lópez-puertas', 'm. lampón', 'f. debras', 'a. carmona', 'b. klein', 'e. artigau', 'w. dethier', 's. pelletier', 't. hood', 'r. allart', 'v. bourrier', 'c. cadieux', 'b. charnay', 'n. b. cowan', 'n. j. cook', 'x. delfosse', 'j. -f. donati', 'p. -g. gu', 'g. hébrard', 'e. martioli', 'c. moutou', 'o. venot', 'a. wyttenbach']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09225,True
