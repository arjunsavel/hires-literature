7,2211.09621,high-resolution atmospheric retrievals of wasp-121b transmission   spectroscopy with espresso: consistent relative abundance constraints across   multiple epochs and instruments,astro-ph.ep,"recent progress in high-resolution transmission spectroscopy has offered new avenues in which to characterise the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy allows for the unambiguous detection of molecules/atoms. it has also been used to map both atmospheric dynamics and longitudinal variations in the abundance of species across the morning and evening limbs. we present multiple vlt/espresso observations of the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-121b, from which we constrain relative abundances of various neutral metals consistently across all observations, whilst accounting for the distortion of the exoplanet's signal caused by traditional data processing techniques. we also constrain planetary orbital velocities and $t$-$p$ profiles. we compare our abundance constraints with previous constraints using vlt/uves transmission spectroscopy of wasp-121b, and find our results to be consistent between observations, and also in agreement with stellar values for species previously detected in the atmosphere of wasp-121b. our retrieval framework can also be used to identify potential exospheric species, resulting in extended absorption features beyond the transit equivalent roche limit of wasp-121b ($r_{\rm eqrl}$ $\sim$ 1.3 $r_{\rm p}$). h$\alpha$, fe ii, and ca ii were found to extend to high altitudes ($1.54\pm0.04$ $r_{\rm p}$, $1.17\pm0.01$ $r_{\rm p}$, and $2.52\pm0.34$ $r_{\rm p}$, respectively), which are broadly consistent with literature values. the consistency of our constraints across multiple high-resolution observations is a strong validation of our model filtering and retrieval framework, as well as the stability of the atmosphere over the timescales of months/years, and could allow for planet formation processes to be inferred from future ground-based observations of exoplanetary atmospheres.",,2022-11-17,,"['cathal maguire', 'neale p. gibson', 'stevanus k. nugroho', 'swaetha ramkumar', 'mark fortune', 'stephanie r. merritt', 'ernst de mooij']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09621,True
