4,2304.03808,"elemental abundances of the super-neptune wasp-107b's host star using   high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy",astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"we present the first elemental abundance measurements of the k dwarf (k7v) exoplanet-host star wasp-107 using high-resolution (r = 45,000), near-infrared (h- and k-band) spectra taken from gemini-s/igrins. we use the previously determined physical parameters of the star from the literature and infer the abundances of 15 elements: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, k, ca, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, and ni, all with precision < 0.1 dex, based on model fitting using marcs model atmospheres and the spectral synthesis code turbospectrum. our results show near-solar abundances and a carbon-to-oxygen ratio (c/o) of 0.50 (+/-0.10), consistent with the solar value of 0.54 (+/-0.09). the orbiting planet, wasp-107b, is a super neptune with a mass in the neptune regime (= 1.8 m_nep) and a radius close to jupiter's (= 0.94 r_jup). this planet is also being targeted by four jwst cycle 1 programs in transit and eclipse, which should provide highly precise measurements of atmospheric abundances. this will enable us to properly compare the planetary and stellar chemical abundances, which is essential in understanding the formation mechanisms, internal structure, and chemical composition of exoplanets. our study is a proof-of-concept that will pave the way for such measurements to be made for all jwst's cooler exoplanet-host stars.",10.3847/1538-4357/accb97,2023-04-07,,"['neda hejazi', 'ian crossfield', 'thomas nordlander', 'megan mansfield', 'diogo souto', 'emilio marfil', 'david coria', 'jonathan brande', 'alex polanski', 'joseph hand', 'kate wienke']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03808,True
