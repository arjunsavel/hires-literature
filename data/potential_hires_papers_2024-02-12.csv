0,2402.06449,the eblm project -- xiii. the absolute dynamical masses of the   circumbinary planet host toi-1338/bebop-1,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"high-contrast eclipsing binaries with low mass m-dwarf secondaries are precise benchmark stars to build empirical mass-radius relationships for fully convective low-mass ($\rm m_{*} < 0.35\,m_{\rm sun}$) dwarf stars. the contributed light of the m-dwarf in such binaries is usually much less than one~per~cent at optical wavelengths. this enables the detection of circumbinary planets from precise radial velocity measurements. high-resolution cross-correlation techniques are typically used to detect exoplanet atmospheres. one key aspect of these techniques is the post-processing, which includes the removal of telluric and spectral lines of the host star. we introduce the application of such techniques to optical high-resolution spectra of the circumbinary planet-host toi-1338/bebop-1, turning it effectively into a double-lined eclipsing binary. by using simulations, we further explore the impact of post-processing techniques for high-contrast systems. we detect the m-dwarf secondary with a significance of 11-$\sigma$ and measure absolute dynamical masses for both components. compared to previous model-dependent mass measurements, we obtain a four times better precision. we further find that the post-processing results in negligible systematic impact on the radial velocity precision for toi-1338/bebop-1 with more than $96.6\,$per~cent (1-$\sigma$) of the m-dwarf's signal being conserved. we show that these methods can be used to robustly measure dynamical masses of high-contrast single-lined binaries providing important benchmark stars for stellar evolution particularly near the bottom of the main sequence. we also demonstrate how to retrieve the phase curve of an exoplanet with high-resolution spectroscopy using our data.",,2024-02-09,,"['d. sebastian', 'a. h. m. j. triaud', 'm. brogi', 't. a. baycroft', 'm. r. standing', 'p. f. l. maxted', 'd. v. martin', 'l. sairam', 'm. b. nielsen']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06449,True
