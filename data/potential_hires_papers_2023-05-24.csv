8,2304.04285,"the mantis network iii: expanding the limits of chemical searches within   ultra hot-jupiters. new detections of ca i, v i, ti i, cr i, ni i, sr ii, ba   ii, and tb ii in kelt-9 b",astro-ph.ep,"cross-correlation spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in the study of exoplanets. however, aliasing between spectral lines makes it vulnerable to systematic biases. this work strives to constrain the aliases of the cross-correlation function to provide increased confidence in the detections of elements in the atmospheres of ultra-hot jupiters (uhjs) observed with high-resolution spectrographs. we use a combination of archival transit observations of the uhj kelt-9 b obtained with the harps-n and carmenes spectrographs and show that it is possible to leverage each instrument's strengths to produce robust detections at substantially reduced signal-to-noise. aliases that become present at low signal-to-noise regimes are constrained through a linear regression model. we confirm previous detections of h i, na i, mg i, ca ii, sc ii, ti ii, cr ii, fe i, and fe ii, and detect eight new species ca i, cr i, ni i, sr ii, tb ii at the 5$\sigma$ level and ti i, v i, ba ii above the 3$\sigma$ level. ionised terbium (tb ii) has never before been seen in an exoplanet atmosphere. we further conclude that a 5$\sigma$ threshold may not provide a reliable measure of confidence when used to claim detections, unless the systematics in the cross-correlation function caused by aliases are taken into account.",10.1051/0004-6361/202245121,2023-04-09,2023-04-28,"['n. w. borsato', 'h. j. hoeijmakers', 'b. prinoth', 'b. thorsbro', 'r. forsberg', 'd. kitzmann', 'k. jones', 'k. heng']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04285,True
9,2305.06206,"a 1.55 r$_{\oplus}$ habitable-zone planet hosted by toi-715, an m4 star   near the ecliptic south pole",astro-ph.ep,"a new generation of observatories is enabling detailed study of exoplanetary atmospheres and the diversity of alien climates, allowing us to seek evidence for extraterrestrial biological and geological processes. now is therefore the time to identify the most unique planets to be characterised with these instruments. in this context, we report on the discovery and validation of toi-715 b, a $r_{\rm b}=1.55\pm 0.06\rm r_{\oplus}$ planet orbiting its nearby ($42$ pc) m4 host (toi-715/tic 271971130) with a period $p_{\rm b} = 19.288004_{-0.000024}^{+0.000027}$ days. toi-715 b was first identified by tess and validated using ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging and statistical validation. the planet's orbital period combined with the stellar effective temperature $t_{\rm eff}=3075\pm75~\rm k$ give this planet an instellation $s_{\rm b} = 0.67_{-0.20}^{+0.15}~\rm s_\oplus$, placing it within the most conservative definitions of the habitable zone for rocky planets. toi-715 b's radius falls exactly between two measured locations of the m-dwarf radius valley; characterising its mass and composition will help understand the true nature of the radius valley for low-mass stars. we demonstrate toi-715 b is amenable for characterisation using precise radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy. additionally, we reveal a second candidate planet in the system, tic 271971130.02, with a potential orbital period of $p_{02} = 25.60712_{-0.00036}^{+0.00031}$ days and a radius of $r_{02} = 1.066\pm0.092\,\rm r_{\oplus}$, just inside the outer boundary of the habitable zone, and near a 4:3 orbital period commensurability. should this second planet be confirmed, it would represent the smallest habitable zone planet discovered by tess to date.",10.1093/mnras/stad1439,2023-05-10,,"['georgina dransfield', 'mathilde timmermans', 'amaury h. m. j. triaud', 'martín dévora-pajares', 'christian aganze', 'khalid barkaoui', 'adam j. burgasser', 'karen a. collins', 'marion cointepas', 'elsa ducrot', 'maximilian n. günther', 'steve b. howell', 'catriona a. murray', 'prajwal niraula', 'benjamin v. rackham', 'daniel sebastian', 'keivan g. stassun', 'sebastián zúñiga-fernández', 'josé manuel almenara', 'xavier bonfils', 'françois bouchy', 'christopher j. burke', 'david charbonneau', 'jessie l. christiansen', 'laetitia delrez', 'tianjun gan', 'lionel j. garcía', 'michaël gillon', 'yilen gómez maqueo chew', 'katharine m. hesse', 'matthew j. hooton', 'giovanni isopi', 'emmanuël jehin', 'jon m. jenkins', 'david w. latham', 'franco mallia', 'felipe murgas', 'peter p. pedersen', 'francisco j. pozuelos', 'didier queloz', 'david r. rodriguez', 'nicole schanche', 'sara seager', 'gregor srdoc', 'chris stockdale', 'joseph d. twicken', 'roland vanderspek', 'robert wells', 'joshua n. winn', 'julien de wit', 'aldo zapparata']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06206,True
