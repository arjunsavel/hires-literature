1,2402.14001,a formally motivated retrieval framework applied to the high resolution   transmission spectrum of hd 189733 b,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"ground-based high-resolution spectra provide a powerful tool for characterising exoplanet atmospheres. however, they are greatly hampered by the dominating telluric and stellar lines, which need to be removed prior to any analysis. such removal techniques (""preparing pipelines"") deform the spectrum, hence a key point is to account for this process in the forward models used in retrievals. we develop a formal derivation on how to prepare froward models for retrievals, in the case where the telluric and instrumental deformations can be represented as a matrix multiplied element-wise with the data. we also introduce the notion of ""bias pipeline metric"" (bpm), that can be used to compare the bias potential of preparing pipelines. we use the resulting framework to retrieve simulated observations of 1-d and 3-d exoplanet atmospheres and to re-analyse high-resolution ($\mathcal{r} \approx 80\,400$) near infrared (0.96--1.71 $\mu$m) carmenes transit data of hd~189733~b. we compare these results with those obtained from a ccf analysis. with our fiducial retrieval, we find a blueshift of the absorption features of $-5.51^{+0.66}_{-0.53}$ km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. in addition, we retrieve a h$_2$o $\log_{10}$(vmr) of $-2.39^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$ and a temperature of $660^{+6}_{-11}$ k. we are also able to put upper limits for the abundances of ch$_4$, co, h$_2$s, hcn and nh$_3$, consistent with a sub-solar metallicity atmosphere enriched in h$_2$o. we retrieve a broadened line shape, consistent with rotation- and wind-induced line broadening. finally, we find a lower limit for the pressure of an opaque cloud consistent with a clear atmosphere, and find no evidence for hazes.",10.3847/1538-3881/ad2c8b,2024-02-21,,"['doriann blain', 'alejandro sánchez-lópez', 'paul mollière']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14001,True
5,2408.13536,"four hd 209458 b transits through crires+: detection of h$_2$o and   non-detections of c$_2$h$_2$, ch$_4$, and hcn",astro-ph.ep,"hd 209458 b is one of the most studied exoplanets to date. despite this, atmospheric characterisation studies yielded inconsistent species detections and abundances. values reported for the c/o ratio range from 0.1 to 1.0. of particular interest is the simultaneous detection of h2o and hcn reported by some studies using high-resolution ground-based observations, which would require the atmospheric c/o ratio to be fine-tuned to a narrow interval around 1. hcn has however not been detected from recent space-based observations.   we aim to provide an independent study of hd 209458 b's atmosphere with high-resolution observations, in order to infer the presence of several species, including h2o and hcn.   we observed four primary transits of hd 209458 b at a high resolution (r=92000) with crires+ in the near infrared (band h, 1.4--1.8 um). after reducing the data with pycrires, we prepared the data using the sysrem algorithm and performed a cross-correlation (ccf) analysis of the transmission spectra. we also compared the results with those obtained from simulated datasets constructed by combining the exo-rem self-consistent model with the petitradtrans package.   combining the four transits, we detect h2o with a signal-to-noise ccf metric of 8.7. this corresponds to a signal emitted at $k_p=151.3^{+31.1}_{-23.4}$ km/s and blueshifted by $-6^{+1}_{-2}$ km/s, consistent with what is expected for hd 209458 b. we do not detect any other species among c2h2, ch4, co, co2, h2s, hcn, and nh3. comparing this with our simulated datasets, this result is consistent with a c/o ratio of 0.1 and an opaque cloud top pressure of 50 pa, at a 3 times solar metallicity. this would also be consistent with recent jwst observations. however, none of the simulated results obtained with a bulk c/o ratio of 0.8, a value suggested by previous studies using giano-b and crires, are consistent with our observations.",,2024-08-24,,"['d. blain', 'r. landman', 'p. mollière', 'j. dittmann']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13536,True
