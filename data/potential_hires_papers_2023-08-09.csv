2,2308.03922,full spectroscopic model and trihybrid   experimental-perturbative-variational line list for zro,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im astro-ph.sr,"zirconium monoxide (zro) absorption lines define rare s-type stars and are currently being sought on exoplanets. successful detection is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive line list, with existing data not ideal for many applications. specifically, the plez \etal{} line list is near-complete but has insufficient accuracy for high-resolution cross-correlation, while the sorensen \& bernath data has high accuracy but only considers a small number of spectral bands. this article presents a novel spectroscopic model, variational line list and trihybrid line list for the main \zro{} isotopologue, as well as isotopologue-extrapolated hybrid line lists for the \isoa{}, \isob{}, \isoc{}, \isod{}~and \isoe{} isotopologues. these were constructed using \duo{} based on icmrci-sd/casscf~\abinitio{} electronic data calculated using \molpro{}, experimental energies obtained from a previous \marvel{} data compilation and perturbative energies from sorensen \& bernath. the new \zro{} \exomol{}-style trihybrid line list, \llname{}, comprises \noenergies{} energies (\nomaenergies{} experimental) and \notransitions{} transitions up to 30,000~\cm{} (333~nm) between ten low-lying electronic states (\zrox{}, \zroaa{}, \zroa{}, \zrobb{}, \zrob{}, \zroc{}, \zrodd{}, \zroee{}, \zroff{} and \zrof{}). the inclusion of experimental energy levels in \llname{} means zro will be much easier to detect using high-resolution ground-based telescopes in the 12,500 -- 17,500~\cm{} (571 -- 800~nm) spectral region. the inclusion of variational energy levels means that the zorro line list has very high completeness and can accurately model molecular absorption cross-sections even at high temperatures. the \llname{} data will hopefully facilitate the first detection of zro in the atmosphere of a hot jupiter exoplanet, or alternatively more conclusively exclude its presence.",10.1093/mnras/stad2103,2023-08-07,,"['armando n. perri', 'fadia taher', 'laura k. mckemmish']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03922,True
