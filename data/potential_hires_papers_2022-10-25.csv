4,2210.08517,transmission spectroscopy of wasp-7 b with uves -- detection of na i   d$_2$ and tentative d$_1$ line absorption,astro-ph.ep,"transmission spectroscopy is a prime technique to study the chemical composition and structure of exoplanetary atmospheres. strong excess absorption signals have been detected in the optical na i d1, 2 fraunhofer lines during transits of hot jupiters, which are attributed to the planetary atmospheres and allow us to constrain its structure. we study the atmosphere of wasp-7 b by means of high-resolution transit spectroscopy in the sodium lines. we analyzed a spectral transit time series of 89 high-resolution spectra of the hot jupiter wasp-7 b that was observed using the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph (uves). we used the telluric lines for an accurate alignment of the spectra and carry out a telluric correction with molecfit. stellar magnetic activity was monitored by investigating chromospheric lines such as the ca ii h and k and hydrogen h$\alpha$ lines. finally, we obtained transmission spectra and light curves for various lines. the star shows no identifiable flares and, if any, marginal changes in activity during our observing run. the sodium transmission spectra and corresponding light curves clearly show signs of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect (rm) and the stellar center-to-limb variation (clv) that we modeled using synthetic spectra. a statistically significant, narrow absorption feature with a line contrast of 0.50$\pm$0.06% (at $\sim 8.3\sigma$ level) and a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 0.13$\pm$0.02 a is detected at the location of the na i d$_2$ line. for the na i d$_1$ line signal, we derived a line contrast of 0.13$\pm$0.04% (at $\sim 3.2\sigma$ level), which we consider a tentative detection. in addition, we provide upper limits for absorption by the hydrogen balmer lines (h$\alpha$, h$\beta$, and h$\gamma$), k i $\lambda$7699 a, ca ii h and k, and infra-red triplet (irt) lines.",,2022-10-16,2022-10-25,"['hossein rahmati', 'stefan czesla', 'sara khalafinejad', 'paul molliÃ¨re']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08517,True
6,2210.12480,exomol line lists -- xlvii. rovibronic molecular line list of the   calcium monohydroxide radical (caoh),astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr physics.atom-ph,"any future detection of the calcium monohydroxide radical (caoh) in stellar and exoplanetary atmospheres will rely on accurate molecular opacity data. here, we present the first comprehensive molecular line list of caoh covering the \a--\x\ rotation-vibration-electronic and \x--\x\ rotation-vibration bands. the newly computed oyt6 line list contains over 24.2 billion transitions between 3.2 million energy levels with rotational excitation up to $j=175.5$. it is applicable to temperatures up to $t=3000$~k and covers the 0\,--\,35\,000~cm$^{-1}$ range (wavelengths $\lambda > 0.29$~$\mu$m) for rotational, rotation-vibration and the \a--\x\ electronic transition. the strong band around 16\,000~cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda = 0.63$~$\mu$m) is likely to be of interest in future astronomical observations, particularly in hot rocky exoplanets where temperatures can become extremely high. the oyt6 line list has been generated using empirically-refined \x\ and \a\ state potential energy surfaces, high-level \textit{ab initio} transition dipole moment surfaces and a rigorous treatment of both renner-teller and spin-orbit coupling effects, which are necessary for correctly modelling the caoh spectrum. post-processing of the caoh line list has been performed so as to tailor it to high-resolution applications, i.e.\ by replacing calculated energy levels with more accurate empirically-derived values (where available), hence improving the accuracy of the predicted line positions in certain regions. the oyt6 line list is available from the exomol database at http://www.exomol.com and the cds astronomical database.",10.1093/mnras/stac2462,2022-10-22,,"['alec owens', 'alexander mitrushchenkov', 'sergei n. yurchenko', 'jonathan tennyson']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12480,True
