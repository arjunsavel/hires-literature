9,2210.05094,climate of high obliquity exo-terrestrial planets with a   three-dimensional cloud system resolving climate model,astro-ph.ep,"planetary climates are strongly affected by planetary orbital parameters such as obliquity, eccentricity, and precession. in exoplanetary systems, exo-terrestrial planets should have various obliquities. high-obliquity planets would have extreme seasonal cycles due to the seasonal change of the distribution of the insolation. here, we introduce the non-hydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model(nicam), a global cloud-resolving model, to investigate the climate of high-obliquity planets. this model can explicitly simulate a three-dimensional cloud distribution and vertical transports of water vapor. we simulated exo-terrestrial climates with high resolution using the supercomputer fugaku. we assumed aqua-planet configurations with 1 bar of air as a background atmosphere, with four different obliquities ($0^{\circ}$, $23.5^{\circ}$, $45^{\circ}$, and $60^{\circ}$). we ran two sets of simulations: 1) low-resolution (~ 220 km-mesh as the standard resolution of a general circulation model for exoplanetary science) with parametrization for cloud formation, and 2) high-resolution (~ 14 km-mesh) with an explicit cloud microphysics scheme. results suggest that high-resolution simulations with an explicit treatment of cloud microphysics reveal warmer climates due to less low cloud fraction and a large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. it implies that treatments of cloud-related processes lead to a difference between different resolutions in climatic regimes in cases with high obliquities.",,2022-10-10,,"['takanori kodama', 'daisuke takasuka', 'sam sherriff-tadano', 'takeshi kuroda', 'tomoki miyakawa', 'ayako abe-ouchi', 'masaki satoh']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05094,True
