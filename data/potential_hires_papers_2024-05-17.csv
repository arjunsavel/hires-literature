1,2405.09769,the metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the ultra-hot jupiter   wasp-76b from gemini-s/igrins,astro-ph.ep,"measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (c/o) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the c/o ratios of hot jupiter atmospheres. we present two transits of the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 $\mu$m with gemini-s/igrins. we detected the presence of h$_{2}$o, co, and oh at signal-to-noise rations of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. we performed two retrievals on this data set. a free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of $\left[\frac{\mathrm{c}+\mathrm{o}} {\mathrm{h}}\right]=-0.70^{+1.27}_{-0.93}$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of c/o$=0.80^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$. we also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within $1\sigma$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar c/o ratio ($\left[\frac{\mathrm{c}+\mathrm{o}} {\mathrm{h}}\right]=-0.74^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and c/o$=0.59^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$). a variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of wasp-76b. additionally, we found systemic ($v_{sys}$) and keplerian ($k_{p}$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3d general circulation models of wasp-76b, with the exception of a redshifted $v_{sys}$ for h$_{2}$o. future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on wasp-76b will be necessary to understand the h$_{2}$o velocity shift. finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained c/o ratios generally trends toward super-solar c/o ratios. more results from high-resolution observations or jwst will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.",,2024-05-15,,"['megan weiner mansfield', 'michael r. line', 'joost p. wardenier', 'matteo brogi', 'jacob l. bean', 'hayley beltz', 'peter smith', 'joseph a. zalesky', 'natasha batalha', 'eliza m. -r. kempton', 'benjamin t. montet', 'james e. owen', 'peter plavchan', 'emily rauscher']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09769,True
3,2405.09967,unveiling stellar aurorae: simulating auroral emission lines in hot   stars induced by high-energy irradiation,astro-ph.sr,"auroral emission lines result from the interaction between magnetic field and stellar wind, offering valuable insights into physical properties and processes occurring within magnetospheres of celestial bodies. while extensively studied in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, in ultra-cool dwarfs, and as radio emission from early-type stars, the presence of specific auroral emission lines in hot star spectra remains unexplored. in this study, we utilized tlusty code to simulate the auroral lines, while modelling the effect of the interaction between stellar wind and magnetosphere through x-ray irradiation. utilizing high-resolution synthetic spectra generated from model atmospheres, we identified potential candidate lines indicative of auroral emission, which were absent in non-irradiated spectra. emission lines in synthetic spectra were present primarily in the infrared domain. the most prominent line generated by irradiation was he ii 69458 a, which appeared in all our model atmospheres with effective temperatures ranging from 15 kk to 30 kk. we also calculated the minimum irradiation required to detect emission in this most prominent line. the presence of emission lines was interpreted by considering changes in the population of different excited states of given atoms. besides the appearance of infrared emission lines, high-energy irradiation causes infrared excess. to complement our simulations, we also searched for auroral lines in far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) observations, which are deposited in the multimission archive at space telescope (mast) catalogue. the comparison of observed spectra with synthetic spectra did not identify any possible candidate emission lines in fuse spectra.",,2024-05-16,,"['michal kajan', 'jiří krtička', 'jiří kubát']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09967,True
