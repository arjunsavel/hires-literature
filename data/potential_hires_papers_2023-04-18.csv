3,2304.08104,grex-plus science book,astro-ph.co astro-ph.ep astro-ph.ga astro-ph.im astro-ph.sr,"grex-plus (galaxy reionization explorer and planetary universe spectrometer) is a mission candidate for a jaxa's strategic l-class mission to be launched in the 2030s. its primary sciences are two-fold: galaxy formation and evolution and planetary system formation and evolution. the grex-plus spacecraft will carry a 1.2 m primary mirror aperture telescope cooled down to 50 k. the two science instruments will be onboard: a wide-field camera in the 2-8 $\mu$m wavelength band and a high resolution spectrometer with a wavelength resolution of 30,000 in the 10-18 $\mu$m band. the grex-plus wide-field camera aims to detect the first generation of galaxies at redshift $z>15$. the grex-plus high resolution spectrometer aims to identify the location of the water ``snow line'' in proto-planetary disks. both instruments will provide unique data sets for a broad range of scientific topics including galaxy mass assembly, origin of supermassive blackholes, infrared background radiation, molecular spectroscopy in the interstellar medium, transit spectroscopy for exoplanet atmosphere, planetary atmosphere in the solar system, and so on.",,2023-04-17,,"['grex-plus science team', 'n/a :', 'akio k. inoue', 'yuichi harikane', 'takashi moriya', 'hideko nomura', 'shunsuke baba', 'yuka fujii', 'naoteru gouda', 'yasuhiro hirahara', 'yui kawashima', 'tadayuki kodama', 'yusei koyama', 'hiroyuki kurokawa', 'taro matsuo', 'yoshiki matsuoka', 'shuji matsuura', 'ken mawatari', 'toru misawa', 'kentaro nagamine', 'kimihiko nakajima', 'shota notsu', 'takafumi ootsubo', 'kazumasa ohno', 'hideo sagawa', 'takashi shimonishi', 'ken-ichi tadaki', 'michihiro takami', 'tsuyoshi terai', 'yoshiki toba', 'takuji yamashita', 'chikako yasui']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08104,True
5,2304.08518,mapping the skies of ultracool worlds: detecting storms and spots with   extremely large telescopes,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"extremely large telescopes (elts) present an unparalleled opportunity to study the magnetism, atmospheric dynamics, and chemistry of very low mass stars (vlms), brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. instruments such as the giant magellan telescope - consortium large earth finder (gmt/gclef), the thirty meter telescope's multi-objective diffraction-limited high-resolution infrared spectrograph (tmt/modhis), and the european southern observatory's mid-infrared elt imager and spectrograph (elt/metis) provide the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise (s/n) necessary to doppler image ultracool targets' surfaces based on temporal spectral variations due to surface inhomogeneities. using our publicly-available code, $imber$, developed and validated in plummer & wang (2022), we evaluate these instruments' abilities to discern magnetic star spots and cloud systems on a vlm star (trappist-1); two l/t transition ultracool dwarfs (vhs j1256$-$1257 b and simp j0136+0933); and three exoplanets (beta pic b and hr 8799 d and e). we find that tmt/modhis and elt/metis are suitable for doppler imaging the ultracool dwarfs and beta pic b over a single rotation. uncertainties for longitude and radius are typically $\lesssim 10^{\circ}$, and latitude uncertainties range from $\sim 10^{\circ} \ \rm{to} \ 30^{\circ}$. trappist-1's edge-on inclination and low $\upsilon \sin i$ provide a challenge for all three instruments while gmt/gclef and the hr 8799 planets may require observations over multiple rotations. we compare the spectroscopic technique, photometry-only inference, and the combination of the two. we find combining spectroscopic and photometric observations can lead to improved bayesian inference of surface inhomogeneities and offers insight into whether ultracool atmospheres are dominated by spotted or banded features.",,2023-04-17,,"['michael k. plummer', 'ji wang']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08518,True
