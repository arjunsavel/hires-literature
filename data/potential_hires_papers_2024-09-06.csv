3,2409.03124,"up, up, and away: winds and dynamical structure as a function of   altitude in the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-76b",astro-ph.ep,"due to the unprecedented signal strengths offered by the newest high-resolution spectrographs on 10-m class telescopes, exploring the 3d nature of exoplanets is possible with an unprecedented level of precision. in this paper, we present a new technique to probe the vertical structure of exoplanetary winds and dynamics using ensembles of planet absorption lines of varying opacity, and apply it to the well-studied ultra-hot jupiter wasp-76b. we then compare these results to state-of-the-art global circulation models (gcms) with varying magnetic drag prescriptions. we find that the known asymmetric velocity shift in fe i absorption during transit persists at all altitudes, and observe tentative trends for stronger blueshifts and more narrow line profiles deeper in the atmosphere. by comparing three different model prescriptions (a hydrodynamical model with no drag, a magnetic drag model, and a uniform drag model) we are able to rule out the uniform drag model due to inconsistencies with observed trends in the data. we find that the magnetic model is slightly favored over the the hydrodynamic model, and note that this 3-gauss kinematic magnetohydrodynamical gcm is also favored when compared to low-resolution data. future generation high-resolution spectrographs on extremely large telescopes (elts) will greatly increase signals and make methods like these possible with higher precision and for a wider range of objects.",,2024-09-04,,"['aurora y. kesseli', 'hayley beltz', 'emily rauscher', 'i. a. g. snellen']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03124,True
