1,2309.02488,elemental abundances of planets and brown dwarfs imaged around stars   (elpis): i. potential metal enrichment of the exoplanet af lep b and a novel   retrieval approach for cloudy self-luminous atmospheres,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr,"af lep a+b is a remarkable planetary system hosting a gas-giant planet that has the lowest dynamical mass among directly imaged exoplanets. we present an in-depth analysis of the atmospheric composition of the star and planet to probe the planet's formation pathway. based on new high-resolution spectroscopy of af lep a, we measure a uniform set of stellar parameters and elemental abundances (e.g., [fe/h] = $-0.27 \pm 0.31$ dex). the planet's dynamical mass ($2.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ m$_{\rm jup}$) and orbit are also refined using published radial velocities, relative astrometry, and absolute astrometry. we use petitradtrans to perform chemically-consistent atmospheric retrievals for af lep b. the radiative-convective equilibrium temperature profiles are incorporated as parameterized priors on the planet's thermal structure, leading to a robust characterization for cloudy self-luminous atmospheres. this novel approach is enabled by constraining the temperature-pressure profiles via the temperature gradient $(d\ln{t}/d\ln{p})$, a departure from previous studies that solely modeled the temperature. through multiple retrievals performed on different portions of the $0.9-4.2$ $\mu$m spectrophotometry, along with different priors on the planet's mass and radius, we infer that af lep b likely possesses a metal-enriched atmosphere ([fe/h] $> 1.0$ dex). af lep b's potential metal enrichment may be due to planetesimal accretion, giant impacts, and/or core erosion. the first process coincides with the debris disk in the system, which could be dynamically excited by af lep b and lead to planetesimal bombardment. our analysis also determines $t_{\rm eff} \approx 800$ k, $\log{(g)} \approx 3.7$ dex, and the presence of silicate clouds and dis-equilibrium chemistry in the atmosphere. straddling the l/t transition, af lep b is thus far the coldest exoplanet with suggested evidence of silicate clouds.",,2023-09-05,,"['zhoujian zhang', 'paul molli√®re', 'keith hawkins', 'catherine manea', 'jonathan j. fortney', 'caroline v. morley', 'andrew skemer', 'mark s. marley', 'brendan p. bowler', 'aarynn l. carter', 'kyle franson', 'zachary g. maas', 'christopher sneden']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02488,True
