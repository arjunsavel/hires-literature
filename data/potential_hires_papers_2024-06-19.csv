2,2406.12240,a comparative simulation study of hot and ultra-hot jupiter atmospheres   using different ground-based high-resolution spectrographs with   cross-correlation spectroscopy,astro-ph.ep,"in the era of state-of-the-art space-borne telescopes, high-resolution ground-based observation has emerged as a crucial method for characterizing exoplanets, providing essential insights into their atmospheric compositions. in the optical and nir regions, high-resolution spectroscopy has been powerful for hot jupiters (hj) and ultra-hot jupiters (uhj) during their primary transits, as it can probe molecules with better sensitivity. here, we focus on a comparative simulation study of wasp-76 b (uhj) and wasp-77 a b (hj) for different number of transits, utilizing three ground-based spectrographs (giano-b (tng), carmenes (caha), and andes (e-elt)) with varying instrumental parameters, spectral coverages, and resolutions. we aim to evaluate the feasibility of the upcoming ground-based european extremely large telescope (e-elt) in probing molecules from planet atmospheres and how it surpasses other ground-based observatories in terms of detectability. with the 1-d model, petitcode, we have self-consistently simulated the atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles, which are subsequently integrated into the 1-d chemical kinetics model, vulcan, to evolve the atmospheric chemistry. high-resolution spectra are obtained by performing line-by-line radiative transfer using petitradtrans. finally, we use the resulting spectra to assess the detectability (sigma_det) of molecular bands, employing the ground-based noise simulator spectr. utilizing cross-correlation spectroscopy, we have successfully demonstrated the robust consistency between our simulation study and real-time observations for both planets. andes excels overall in molecular detection due to its enhanced instrumental architecture, reinforcing e-elt's importance for studying exoplanet atmospheres. additionally, our theoretical simulations predict the detection of co, nh3, and h2s on wasp-76 b atmosphere with a sigma_det> 3.",,2024-06-17,,"['dwaipayan dubey', 'liton majumdar']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12240,True
