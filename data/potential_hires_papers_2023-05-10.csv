9,2305.05697,the hazy and metal-rich atmosphere of gj 1214 b constrained by near and   mid-infrared transmission spectroscopy,astro-ph.ep,"the near-infrared transmission spectrum of the warm sub-neptune exoplanet gj 1214 b has been observed to be flat and featureless, implying a high metallicity atmosphere with abundant aerosols. recent jwst miri lrs observations of a phase curve of gj 1214 b showed that its transmission spectrum is flat out into the mid-infrared. in this paper, we use the combined near- and mid-infrared transmission spectrum of gj 1214 b to constrain its atmospheric composition and aerosol properties. we generate a grid of photochemical haze models using an aerosol microphysics code for a number of background atmospheres spanning metallicities from 100 to 1000 $\times$ solar, as well as a steam atmosphere scenario. the flatness of the combined data set largely rules out atmospheric metallicities $\leq$300 $\times$ solar due to their large corresponding molecular feature amplitudes, preferring values $\geq$1000 $\times$ solar and column haze production rates $\geq$10$^{-10}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. the steam atmosphere scenario with similarly high haze production rates also exhibit sufficiently small molecular features to be consistent with the transmission spectrum. these compositions imply that atmospheric mean molecular weights $\geq$15 g mol$^{-1}$ are needed to fit the data. our results suggest that haze production is highly efficient on gj 1214 b and could involve non-hydrocarbon, non-nitrogen haze precursors. further characterization of gj 1214 b's atmosphere would likely require multiple transits and eclipses using jwst across the near and mid-infrared, potentially complemented by groundbased high resolution transmission spectroscopy.",,2023-05-09,,"['peter gao', 'anjali a. a. piette', 'maria e. steinrueck', 'matthew c. nixon', 'michael zhang', 'eliza m. r. kempton', 'jacob l. bean', 'emily rauscher', 'vivien parmentier', 'natasha e. batalha', 'arjun b. savel', 'kenneth e. arnold', 'michael t. roman', 'isaac malsky', 'jake taylor']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05697,True
10,2305.06206,"a 1.55 r$_{\oplus}$ habitable-zone planet hosted by toi-715, an m4 star   near the ecliptic south pole",astro-ph.ep,"a new generation of observatories is enabling detailed study of exoplanetary atmospheres and the diversity of alien climates, allowing us to seek evidence for extraterrestrial biological and geological processes. now is therefore the time to identify the most unique planets to be characterised with these instruments. in this context, we report on the discovery and validation of toi-715 b, a $r_{\rm b}=1.55\pm 0.06\rm r_{\oplus}$ planet orbiting its nearby ($42$ pc) m4 host (toi-715/tic 271971130) with a period $p_{\rm b} = 19.288004_{-0.000024}^{+0.000027}$ days. toi-715 b was first identified by tess and validated using ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging and statistical validation. the planet's orbital period combined with the stellar effective temperature $t_{\rm eff}=3075\pm75~\rm k$ give this planet an instellation $s_{\rm b} = 0.67_{-0.20}^{+0.15}~\rm s_\oplus$, placing it within the most conservative definitions of the habitable zone for rocky planets. toi-715 b's radius falls exactly between two measured locations of the m-dwarf radius valley; characterising its mass and composition will help understand the true nature of the radius valley for low-mass stars. we demonstrate toi-715 b is amenable for characterisation using precise radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy. additionally, we reveal a second candidate planet in the system, tic 271971130.02, with a potential orbital period of $p_{02} = 25.60712_{-0.00036}^{+0.00031}$ days and a radius of $r_{02} = 1.066\pm0.092\,\rm r_{\oplus}$, just inside the outer boundary of the habitable zone, and near a 4:3 orbital period commensurability. should this second planet be confirmed, it would represent the smallest habitable zone planet discovered by tess to date.",,2023-05-10,,"['georgina dransfield', 'mathilde timmermans', 'amaury h. m. j. triaud', 'martín dévora-pajares', 'christian aganze', 'khalid barkaoui', 'adam j. burgasser', 'karen a. collins', 'marion cointepas', 'elsa ducrot', 'maximilian n. günther', 'steve b. howell', 'catriona a. murray', 'prajwal niraula', 'benjamin v. rackham', 'daniel sebastian', 'keivan g. stassun', 'sebastián zúñiga-fernández', 'josé manuel almenara', 'xavier bonfils', 'françois bouchy', 'christopher j. burke', 'david charbonneau', 'jessie l. christiansen', 'laetitia delrez', 'tianjun gan', 'lionel j. garcía', 'michaël gillon', 'yilen gómez maqueo chew', 'katharine m. hesse', 'matthew j. hooton', 'giovanni isopi', 'emmanuël jehin', 'jon m. jenkins', 'david w. latham', 'franco mallia', 'felipe murgas', 'peter p. pedersen', 'francisco j. pozuelos', 'didier queloz', 'david r. rodriguez', 'nicole schanche', 'sara seager', 'gregor srdoc', 'chris stockdale', 'joseph d. twicken', 'roland vanderspek', 'robert wells', 'joshua n. winn', 'julien de wit', 'aldo zapparata']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06206,True
