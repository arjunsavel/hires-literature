5,2406.00111,stellar characterization and chemical abundances of exoplanet hosting m   dwarfs from apogee spectra: future jwst targets,astro-ph.sr astro-ph.ep,"exoplanets hosting m dwarfs are the best targets to characterize earth-like or super-earth planetary atmospheres with the james webb space telescope (jwst). we determine detailed stellar parameters ($t_{\rm eff}$, log$g$, and $\xi$) and individual abundances of twelve elements for four cool m dwarfs hosting exoplanets toi-1685, gj 436, gj 3470, and toi-2445, scheduled for future observations by the jwst. the analysis utilizes high-resolution near-infrared spectra from the sdss-iv apogee survey between 1.51-1.69$\mu$. based on 1d-lte plane-parallel models, we find that toi-2445 is slightly metal-poor ([fe/h] = -0.16$\pm$0.09), while toi-1685, gj 436 and gj 3470 are more metal-rich ([fe/h] = 0.06$\pm$0.18, 0.10$\pm$0.20 dex, 0.25$\pm$0.15). the derived c/o ratios for toi-2445, toi-1685, gj 436, and gj 3470 are 0.526$\pm$0.027, 0.558$\pm$0.097, 0.561$\pm$0.029, and 0.638$\pm$0.015, respectively. from results for 28 m dwarfs analyzed homogeneously from apogee spectra, we find exoplanet-hosting m dwarfs exhibit a c/o abundance ratio approximately 0.01 to 0.05 higher than those with non-detected exoplanets, at limits of a statistically significant offset. a linear regression of [fe/h] \textit{vs.} c/o distribution reveals a noticeable difference in the angular coefficient between fgk dwarfs (0.27) and m dwarfs (0.13). assuming our abundance ratios of ca/mg, si/mg, al/mg, and fe/mg, we determine a mass of 3.276$^{+0.448}_{-0.419}$$m_{\oplus}$ for toi-2445 b, having density (6.793$^{+0.005}_{-0.099}$ g.cm$^{-3}$) and core mass fraction (0.329$_{-0.049}^{+0.028}$) very similar to earth's. we also present an atlas of 113 well-defined spectral lines to analyze m dwarfs in the $h$-band and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties from variations in the atmospheric parameters, signal-to-noise, and pseudo-continuum.",,2024-05-31,,"['edypo melo', 'diogo souto', 'katia cunha', 'verne v. smith', 'f√°bio wanderley', 'vinicius grilo', 'deusalete camara', 'kely murta', 'neda hejazi', 'ian j. m. crossfield', 'johanna teske', 'rafael luque', 'michael zhang', 'jacob bean']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00111,True
