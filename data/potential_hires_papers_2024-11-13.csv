2,2411.07303,peering into the black box: forward-modeling the uncertainty budget of   high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.im,"ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (hrccs; r >~ 15,000) is a powerful complement to space-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres. by resolving individual spectral lines, hrccs can precisely measure chemical abundance ratios, directly constrain atmospheric dynamics, and robustly probe multidimensional physics. but the subtleties of hrccs datasets -- e.g., the lack of exoplanetary spectra visible by eye and the statistically complex process of telluric removal -- can make interpreting them difficult. in this work, we seek to clarify the uncertainty budget of hrccs with a forward-modeling approach. we present a hrccs observation simulator, scope (https://github.com/arjunsavel/scope), that incorporates spectral contributions from the exoplanet, star, tellurics, and instrument. this tool allows us to control the underlying dataset, enabling controlled experimentation with complex hrccs methods. simulating a fiducial hot jupiter dataset (wasp-77ab emission with igrins), we first confirm via multiple tests that the commonly used principal components analysis does not bias the planetary signal when few components are used. furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics and moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in hrccs detection significance. however, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can bias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances. additionally, in the low-snr limit, constraints on gas abundances become highly non-gaussian. our investigation of the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in hrccs data analysis enables greater confidence in scientific results from this maturing method.",,2024-11-11,,"['arjun b. savel', 'megan bedell', 'eliza m. -r. kempton', 'peter smith', 'jacob l. bean', 'lily l. zhao', 'kaze w. k. wong', 'jorge a. sanchez', 'michael r. line']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07303,True
3,2411.07377,chemical fingerprints of m dwarfs: high-resolution spectroscopy on 31 m   dwarfs with spirou,astro-ph.sr astro-ph.ep,"we extend the methodology introduced by jahandar et al. (2024) to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly-rotating solar neighborhood m dwarfs (m1-m5) using high-resolution spectra from cfht/spirou. this group includes 10 m dwarfs in binary systems with fgk primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. by testing our $t_{\rm eff}$ method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of $\sim$10 k at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of $-$29 $\pm$ 31 k. taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the $t_{\rm eff}$ values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and nir studies. our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using $\chi^2$ minimization using phoenix-aces stellar atmosphere models. we present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as si, mg, and fe, which are important for modelling the interior structure of exoplanets. in binary systems, we find an average [fe/h] of $-$0.15 $\pm$ 0.08 for m dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of $-$0.06 $\pm$ 0.18 for the fgk primaries from mann et al. (2013a). we also observe slightly sub-solar chemistry for various elements in our non-binary m dwarfs, most notably for o, c, and k abundances. in particular, we find an average metallicity of $-$0.11 $\pm$ 0.16 lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of fgk stars (e.g. [fe/h] = 0.04 $\pm$ 0.20 from brewer et al. 2016). this study highlights significant discrepancies in various major m dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.",,2024-11-11,,"['farbod jahandar', 'rené doyon', 'étienne artigau', 'neil j. cook', 'charles cadieux', 'jean-françois donati', 'nicolas b. cowan', 'ryan cloutier', 'stefan pelletier', 'alan alves-brito', 'jorge h. c. martins', 'hsien shang', 'andrés carmona']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07377,True
