3,2406.12996,toi-2374 b and toi-3071 b: two metal-rich sub-saturns well within the   neptunian desert,astro-ph.ep,"we report the discovery of two transiting planets detected by the transiting exoplanet survey satellite (tess), toi-2374 b and toi-3071 b, orbiting a k5v and an f8v star, respectively, with periods of 4.31 and 1.27 days, respectively. we confirm and characterize these two planets with a variety of ground-based and follow-up observations, including photometry, precise radial velocity monitoring and high-resolution imaging. the planetary and orbital parameters were derived from a joint analysis of the radial velocities and photometric data. we found that the two planets have masses of $(57 \pm 4)$ $m_\oplus$ or $(0.18 \pm 0.01)$ $m_j$, and $(68 \pm 4)$ $m_\oplus$ or $(0.21 \pm 0.01)$ $m_j$, respectively, and they have radii of $(6.8 \pm 0.3)$ $r_\oplus$ or $(0.61 \pm 0.03)$ $r_j$ and $(7.2 \pm 0.5)$ $r_\oplus$ or $(0.64 \pm 0.05)$ $r_j$, respectively. these parameters correspond to sub-saturns within the neptunian desert, both planets being hot and highly irradiated, with $t_{\rm eq} \approx 745$ $k$ and $t_{\rm eq} \approx 1812$ $k$, respectively, assuming a bond albedo of 0.5. toi-3071 b has the hottest equilibrium temperature of all known planets with masses between $10$ and $300$ $m_\oplus$ and radii less than $1.5$ $r_j$. by applying gas giant evolution models we found that both planets, especially toi-3071 b, are very metal-rich. this challenges standard formation models which generally predict lower heavy-element masses for planets with similar characteristics. we studied the evolution of the planets' atmospheres under photoevaporation and concluded that both are stable against evaporation due to their large masses and likely high metallicities in their gaseous envelopes.",,2024-06-18,,"['alejandro hacker', 'rodrigo f. díaz', 'david j. armstrong', 'jorge fernández fernández', 'simon müller', 'elisa delgado-mena', 'sérgio g. sousa', 'vardan adibekyan', 'keivan g. stassun', 'karen a. collins', 'samuel w. yee', 'daniel bayliss', 'allyson bieryla', 'françois bouchy', 'r. paul butler', 'jeffrey d. crane', 'xavier dumusque', 'joel d. hartman', 'ravit helled', 'jon jenkins', 'marcelo aron f. keniger', 'hannah lewis', 'jorge lillo-box', 'michael b. lund', 'louise d. nielsen', 'ares osborn', 'david osip', 'martin paegert', 'don j. radford', 'nuno c. santos', 'sara seager', 'stephen a. shectman', 'gregor srdoc', 'paul a. strøm', 'thiam-guan tan', 'johanna k. teske', 'michael vezie', 'david watanabe', 'cristilyn n. watkins', 'peter j. wheatley', 'joshua n. winn', 'bill wohler', 'carl ziegler']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12996,True
6,2406.14072,"igrins observations of wasp-127 b: h$_2$o, co, and super-solar   atmospheric metallicity in the inflated sub-saturn",astro-ph.ep,"high resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres provides insights into their composition and dynamics from the resolved line shape and depth of thousands of spectral lines. wasp-127 b is an extremely inflated sub-saturn (r$_\mathrm{p}$= 1.311 r$_\mathrm{jup}$, m$_\mathrm{p}$= 0.16 m$_\mathrm{jup}$) with previously reported detections of h$_2$o, co$_2$, and na. however, the seeming absence of the primary carbon reservoir expected at wasp-127 b temperatures (t$_{eq}$ $\sim$ 1400 k) from chemical equilibrium, co, posed a mystery. in this manuscript, we present the analysis of high resolution observations of wasp-127 b with the immersion grating infrared spectrometer (igrins) on gemini south. we confirm the presence of h$_2$o (8.67 $\sigma$) and report the detection of co (4.34 $\sigma$). additionally, we conduct a suite of bayesian retrieval analyses covering a hierarchy of model complexity and self-consistency. when freely fitting for the molecular gas volume mixing ratios, we obtain super-solar metal enrichment for h$_2$o abundance of log$_{10}$x$_\mathrm{h_2o}$ = --1.23$^{+0.29}_{-0.49}$ and a lower limit on the co abundance of log$_{10}$x$_\mathrm{co}$ $\ge$ --2.20 at 2$\sigma$ confidence. we also report a tentative evidence of photochemistry in wasp-127 b based upon the indicative depletion of h$_2$s. this is also supported by the data preferring models with photochemistry over free-chemistry and thermochemistry. the overall analysis implies a super-solar ($\sim$ 39$\times$ solar; [m/h] = $1.59^{+0.30}_{-0.30}$) metallicity for the atmosphere of wasp-127 b and an upper limit on its atmospheric c/o ratio as $<$ 0.68.",,2024-06-20,,"['krishna kanumalla', 'michael r. line', 'megan weiner mansfield', 'luis welbanks', 'peter c. b. smith', 'jacob l. bean', 'lorenzo pino', 'matteo brogi', 'vatsal panwar']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14072,True
