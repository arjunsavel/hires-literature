1,2208.04759,unifying high- and low-resolution observations to constrain the dayside   atmosphere of kelt-20b/mascara-2b,astro-ph.ep,"we present high-resolution dayside thermal emission observations of the exoplanet kelt-20b/mascara-2b using the maroon-x spectrograph. applying the cross-correlation method with both empirical and theoretical masks and a retrieval analysis, we confirm previous detections of fe\,\textsc{i} emission lines and we detect ni\,\textsc{i} for the first time in the planet (at 4.7$\sigma$ confidence). we do not see evidence for additional species in the maroon-x data, including notably predicted thermal inversion agents tio and vo, their atomic constituents ti\,\textsc{i} and v\,\textsc{i}, and previously claimed species fe\,\textsc{ii} and cr\,\textsc{i}. we also perform a joint retrieval with existing \textit{hubble space telescope}/wfc3 spectroscopy and \textit{spitzer}/irac photometry. this allows us to place bounded constraints on the abundances of fe\,\textsc{i}, h$_2$o, and co, and to place a stringent upper limit on the tio abundance. the results are consistent with kelt-20b having a solar to slightly super-solar composition atmosphere in terms of the bulk metal enrichment, and the carbon-to-oxygen and iron-to-oxygen ratios. however, the tio volume mixing ratio upper limit (10$^{-7.6}$ at 99\% confidence) is inconsistent with this picture, which, along with the non-detection of ti\,\textsc{i}, points to sequestration of ti species, possibly due to nightside condensation. the lack of tio but the presence of a large h$_2$o emission feature in the wfc3 data is challenging to reconcile within the context of 1d self-consistent, radiative-convective models.",10.3847/1538-3881/ac9f40,2022-08-09,2022-11-04,"['david kasper', 'jacob l. bean', 'michael r. line', 'andreas seifahrt', 'madison t. brady', 'joshua lothringer', 'lorenzo pino', 'guangwei fu', 'stefan pelletier', 'julian stürmer', 'björn benneke', 'matteo brogi', 'jean-michel désert']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04759,True
2,2209.10618,atmospheric characterization of the ultra-hot jupiter wasp-33b:   detection of ti and v emission lines and retrieval of a broadened line   profile,astro-ph.ep,"ultra-hot jupiters are highly irradiated gas giant exoplanets on close-in orbits around their host stars. we analyzed high-resolution spectra from carmenes, harps-n, and espadons taken over eight observation nights to study the emission spectrum of wasp-33b and draw conclusions about its atmosphere. by applying the cross-correlation technique, we detected the spectral signatures of ti i, v i, and a tentative signal of ti ii for the first time via emission spectroscopy. these detections are an important finding because of the fundamental role of ti- and v-bearing species in the planetary energy balance. moreover, we assessed and confirm the presence of oh, fe i, and si i from previous studies. the spectral lines are all detected in emission, which unambiguously proves the presence of an inverted temperature profile in the planetary atmosphere. by performing retrievals on the emission lines of all the detected species, we determined a relatively weak atmospheric thermal inversion extending from approximately 3400 k to 4000 k. we infer a supersolar metallicity close to 1.5 dex in the planetary atmosphere, and find that its emission signature undergoes significant line broadening with a gaussian fwhm of about 4.5 km/s. also, we find that the atmospheric temperature profile retrieved at orbital phases far from the secondary eclipse is about 300 k to 700 k cooler than that measured close to the secondary eclipse, which is consistent with different day- and nightside temperatures. moreover, retrievals performed on the emission lines of the individual chemical species lead to consistent results, which gives additional confidence to our retrieval method. increasing the number of species included in the retrieval and expanding the set of retrieved atmospheric parameters will further advance our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.",10.1051/0004-6361/202244277,2022-09-21,,"['d. cont', 'f. yan', 'a. reiners', 'l. nortmann', 'k. molaverdikhani', 'e. pallé', 'th. henning', 'i. ribas', 'a. quirrenbach', 'j. a. caballero', 'p. j. amado', 's. czesla', 'f. lesjak', 'm. lópez-puertas', 'p. mollière', 'd. montes', 'g. morello', 'e. nagel', 's. pedraz', 'a. sánchez-lópez']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10618,True
