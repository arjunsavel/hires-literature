0,2208.04759,unifying high- and low-resolution observations to constrain the dayside   atmosphere of kelt-20b/mascara-2b,astro-ph.ep,"we present high-resolution dayside thermal emission observations of the exoplanet kelt-20b/mascara-2b using the maroon-x spectrograph. applying the cross-correlation method with both empirical and theoretical masks and a retrieval analysis, we confirm previous detections of fe\,\textsc{i} emission lines and we detect ni\,\textsc{i} for the first time in the planet (at 4.7$\sigma$ confidence). we do not see evidence for additional species in the maroon-x data, including notably predicted thermal inversion agents tio and vo, their atomic constituents ti\,\textsc{i} and v\,\textsc{i}, and previously claimed species fe\,\textsc{ii} and cr\,\textsc{i}. we also perform a joint retrieval with existing \textit{hubble space telescope}/wfc3 spectroscopy and \textit{spitzer}/irac photometry. this allows us to place bounded constraints on the abundances of fe\,\textsc{i}, h$_2$o, and co, and to place a stringent upper limit on the tio abundance. the results are consistent with kelt-20b having a solar to slightly super-solar composition atmosphere in terms of the bulk metal enrichment, and the carbon-to-oxygen and iron-to-oxygen ratios. however, the tio volume mixing ratio upper limit (10$^{-7.6}$ at 99\% confidence) is inconsistent with this picture, which, along with the non-detection of ti\,\textsc{i}, points to sequestration of ti species, possibly due to nightside condensation. the lack of tio but the presence of a large h$_2$o emission feature in the wfc3 data is challenging to reconcile within the context of 1d self-consistent, radiative-convective models.",,2022-08-09,2022-11-04,"['david kasper', 'jacob l. bean', 'michael r. line', 'andreas seifahrt', 'madison t. brady', 'joshua lothringer', 'lorenzo pino', 'guangwei fu', 'stefan pelletier', 'julian stürmer', 'björn benneke', 'matteo brogi', 'jean-michel désert']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04759,True
