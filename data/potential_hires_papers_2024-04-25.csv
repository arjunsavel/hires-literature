3,2404.15425,the chemistry of extra-solar materials from white dwarf planetary   systems,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr physics.geo-ph,"white dwarf planetary systems provide a unique way to measure the bulk composition of exoplanetary material. extrasolar asteroids/comets/moons which have survived the evolution of their host star can end up in the atmosphere of the white dwarf. asteroids and boulders appear to be the most common pollutants, where we use the term ""asteroids"" to refer to the parent body that is polluting the atmosphere. the presence of the planetary material is detected via absorption lines of heavy elements. white dwarfs with these absorption features are called ""polluted"" white dwarfs. polluted white dwarfs were expected to be rare objects because white dwarfs have high surface gravities, therefore, these heavy elements will settle out of the white dwarf's atmospheres in a short amount of time (paquette et al. 1986). however, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys found that 25-50% of white dwarfs are polluted (zuckerman et al. 2003, 2010; koester et al. 2014). the mechanism responsible for making a polluted white dwarf must be common and efficient. there is strong theoretical and observational evidence that white dwarfs are accreting from planetary material. there are different mechanisms that can deliver exoplanetary material into the roche lobe of the white dwarf. debris disks, transits from disintegrating bodies, and intact planets have all been detected around white dwarfs (e.g., jura et al. 2007; vanderburg et al. 2015, 2020). this chapter will describe how the chemical autopsies are conducted, and what is learnt about exoplanetary material from polluted white dwarfs.",,2024-04-23,,"['siyi xu', 'laura k. rogers', 'simon blouin']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15425,True
7,2404.15430,transiting exoplanet atmospheres in the era of jwst,astro-ph.ep astro-ph.sr physics.geo-ph,"the field of exoplanet atmospheric characterization has recently made considerable advances with the advent of high-resolution spectroscopy from large ground-based telescopes and the commissioning of the james webb space telescope (jwst). we have entered an era in which atmospheric compositions, aerosol properties, thermal structures, mass loss, and three-dimensional effects can be reliably constrained. while the challenges of remote sensing techniques imply that individual exoplanet atmospheres will likely never be characterized to the degree of detail that is possible for solar system bodies, exoplanets present an exciting opportunity to characterize a diverse array of worlds with properties that are not represented in our solar system. this review article summarizes the current state of exoplanet atmospheric studies for transiting planets. we focus on how observational results inform our understanding of exoplanet properties and ultimately address broad questions about planetary formation, evolution, and diversity. this review is meant to provide an overview of the exoplanet atmospheres field for planetary- and geo-scientists without astronomy backgrounds, and exoplanet specialists, alike. we give special attention to the first year of jwst data and recent results in high-resolution spectroscopy that have not been summarized by previous review articles.",,2024-04-23,,"['eliza m. -r. kempton', 'heather a. knutson']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15430,True
