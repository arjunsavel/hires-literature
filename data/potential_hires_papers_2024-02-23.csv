3,2402.14312,the jiao tong university spectroscopic telescope project,astro-ph.im astro-ph.co astro-ph.ep astro-ph.ga,"the jiao tong university spectroscopic telescope (just) is a 4.4-meter f/6.0 segmentedmirror telescope dedicated to spectroscopic observations. the just primary mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, each with a diameter of 1.1 m. just provides two nasmyth platforms for placing science instruments. one nasmyth focus fits a field of view of 10 arcmin and the other has an extended field of view of 1.2 deg with correction optics. a tertiary mirror is used to switch between the two nasmyth foci. just will be installed at a site at lenghu in qinghai province, china, and will conduct spectroscopic observations with three types of instruments to explore the dark universe, trace the dynamic universe, and search for exoplanets: (1) a multi-fiber (2000 fibers) medium-resolution spectrometer (r=4000-5000) to spectroscopically map galaxies and large-scale structure; (2) an integral field unit (ifu) array of 500 optical fibers and/or a long-slit spectrograph dedicated to fast follow-ups of transient sources for multimessenger astronomy; (3) a high-resolution spectrometer (r~100000) designed to identify jupiter analogs and earth-like planets, with the capability to characterize the atmospheres of hot exoplanets.",10.61977/ati2024008,2024-02-22,,"['n/a just team', 'chengze liu', 'ying zu', 'fabo feng', 'zhaoyu li', 'yu yu', 'hua bai', 'xiangqun cui', 'bozhong gu', 'yizhou gu', 'jiaxin han', 'yonghui hou', 'zhongwen hu', 'hangxin ji', 'yipeng jing', 'wei li', 'zhaoxiang qi', 'xianyu tan', 'cairang tian', 'dehua yang', 'xiangyan yuan', 'chao zhai', 'congcong zhang', 'jun zhang', 'haotong zhang', 'pengjie zhang', 'yong zhang', 'yi zhao', 'xianzhong zheng', 'qingfeng zhu', 'xiaohu yang']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14312,True
